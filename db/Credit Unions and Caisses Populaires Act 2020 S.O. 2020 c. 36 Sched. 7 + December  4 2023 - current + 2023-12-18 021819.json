Same (6) No interest is payable on transferred unclaimed amounts if the Authority rules so specify. Limitation on Authority liability (7) The Authority is not liable to pay a claim for transferred unclaimed amounts if, (a)  the transferred unclaimed amount is less than $1,000 and at least 40 years have elapsed since the transfer from the credit union to the Authority under subsection (2); or (b)  the transferred unclaimed amount is $1,000 or more and at least 100 years have elapsed since the transfer from the credit union to the Authority under subsection (2).

Appointment of liquidator (7) The court making the winding-up order may appoint one or more persons as liquidator of the estate and effects of the credit union for the purpose of winding up its affairs and distributing its property. Remuneration (8) The court may at any time fix the remuneration of the liquidator and the costs, charges and expenses of the winding-up.

Notice of appointment (12) The Chief Executive Officer shall publish a notice of the liquidator’s appointment on the website of the Authority. Proceedings in winding-up after order (13) If a winding-up order has been made by the court, proceedings for the winding up of the credit union must be taken in the same manner and with the like consequences as are provided for a voluntary winding-up, except that, (a)  the list of contributories shall be settled by the court unless it has been settled by the liquidator before the winding-up order; and (b)  all proceedings in the winding-up are subject to the order and direction of the court. Review by court (14) If the list of contributories has been settled by the liquidator before the winding-up order, it is subject to review by the court. Meeting of members may be ordered (15) If a winding-up order has been made by the court, the court may direct meetings of the members of the credit union to be called, held and conducted in such manner as the court thinks fit for the purpose of ascertaining their wishes, and may appoint a person to act as chair of the meeting and to report the results of it to the court. Order for delivery of property (16) If a winding-up order has been made by the court, the court may require any contributory for the time being settled on the list of contributories, or any director, employee, trustee, receiver, banker, agent or officer of the credit union, to pay, deliver, convey, surrender or transfer promptly, or within such time as the court directs, to the liquidator any money, record, document, estate or effects that are in any such person’s hands and to which the credit union is apparently entitled. Inspection of documents and records (17) If a winding-up order is made by the court, the court may make an order for the inspection of the records and documents of the credit union by its creditors and contributories, and any records and documents in the possession of the credit union may be inspected in conformity with the order. No proceedings against credit union without leave (18) After a winding-up order is made, no suit, action or other proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the credit union, except with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court imposes. Attachments, etc., void (19) Every attachment, sequestration, distress or execution put in force against the estate or effects of a credit union after a winding-up order is made is void. Provision for discharge of liquidator and distribution by the court (20) If the realization and distribution of the property of a credit union being wound up under an order of the court has proceeded so far that, in the opinion of the court it is expedient that the liquidator should be discharged and that the property of the credit union remaining in the liquidator’s hands can be better realized and distributed by the court, the court may make an order discharging the liquidator and for payment, delivery and transfer into court, or to such officer or person as the court directs, of such property, and it shall be realized and distributed by or under the direction of the court among the persons entitled thereto in the same way as nearly as may be as if the distribution were being made by the liquidator and the court may make an order directing how the documents and records of the credit union and of the liquidator are to be disposed of, and may order that they be deposited in court or otherwise dealt with as the court considers appropriate. Order for dissolution (21) The court at any time after the affairs of the credit union have been fully wound up may, upon the application of the liquidator or any other interested person, make an order dissolving it, and it is dissolved on the date fixed in the order. Notice to Chief Executive Officer (22) The person on whose application the order was made shall, within 10 days after it was made, file with the Chief Executive Officer a certified copy of the order and the Chief Executive Officer shall publish notice of the dissolution on the website of the Authority.",

Bills of exchange deemed drawn in the course of business (2) The execution, endorsement or making of all agreements, contracts, bills of exchange or other documents by a liquidator on behalf of a credit union has the same effect with respect to the rights and liabilities of the credit union as if the agreements, contracts or bills of exchange or other documents had been executed, endorsed or made by or on behalf of the credit union in the course of carrying on its business. Where approval required (3) The liquidator shall not exercise power granted under clause (1) (a), (d), (f), (m) or (n), (a)  in the case of a voluntary winding-up or a liquidator appointed by the Chief Executive Officer under section 241, unless the liquidator has obtained the approval in writing of the Chief Executive Officer; or (b)  in the case of a winding-up by order of the court, unless the liquidator has obtained the approval of the court. Exception (4) Clause (3) (a) does not apply where the Chief Executive Officer is the liquidator. Notice of liability of contributory (5) The liability of a contributory is a debt accruing due from the contributory at the time when the contributory’s liability commenced, but payable at the time when calls are made for enforcing the liability. Liability in case of death (6) If a contributory dies before or after being placed on the list of contributories, the deceased contributory’s personal representative, in administering the estate of the contributory, is liable to contribute to the property of the credit union in discharge of the liability of the deceased contributory and shall be a contributory accordingly.
