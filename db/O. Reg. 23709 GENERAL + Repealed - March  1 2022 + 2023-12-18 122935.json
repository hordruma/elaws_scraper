(2) A credit union may create a security interest in personal property of the credit union if the property, together with any other property of the credit union subject to a security interest under this subsection, has an aggregate value of less than the greater of, (a) $25,000; and (b) one per cent of the credit union’s total assets, as set out in the audited financial statements of the credit union that were placed before its members at the most recent annual meeting.  O. Reg. 237/09, s. 48 (2). (3) A credit union may create a security interest in property of the credit union if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The security interest is granted to secure a debt, including any obligation of the credit union to an entity listed in paragraph 2 that is a member of the Canadian Payments Association to settle for payment items of the credit union in accordance with the by-laws and rules of the Canadian Payments Association, which together with other debts for which the credit union has granted a security interest does not exceed 15 per cent of the credit union’s total assets, as set out in the audited financial statements of the credit union that were placed before its members at the most recent annual meeting. 2. The debt is owed to, i. a bank or authorized foreign bank within the meaning of section 2 of the Bank Act (Canada), ii. a corporation registered under the Loan and Trust Corporations Act, or iii. a league, Central 1 Credit Union or Fédération des caisses Desjardins du Québec. iv.  Revoked: O. Reg. 68/17, s. 12 (1). 3. The security agreement under which the security interest is granted provides that the security interest is granted over specifically identified assets and does not create a general charge against the business and undertaking of the credit union. 4. The security interest is limited by its terms to property with a value, together with the total value of all property subject to a security interest under this subsection, that does not exceed 25 per cent of the value of the credit union’s total assets as set out in the audited financial statements of the credit union that were placed before its members at the most recent annual meeting. 5.

A guarantee of payment for the outstanding balance, as of the close of business on the day of the assignment, of the indebtedness of the credit union secured by the agreement. iii. Partial payment of the outstanding balance of the indebtedness of the credit union secured by the agreement and a guarantee of payment for the portion of the outstanding balance not paid as of the close of business on the day of the assignment. 3. The security agreement under which the security interest is granted provides that despite paragraph 2, if, i. the security interest granted by the credit union forms part of the collateral security granted or assigned by Central 1 Credit Union to the Bank of Canada as security for an emergency liquidity assistance facility from the Bank of Canada, and ii. the Chief Executive Officer orders the credit union to be subject to administration under section 294 of the Act or the Chief Executive Officer is appointed liquidator of the assets of the credit union, the Chief Executive Officer may require the security agreement be assigned to the Authority only if the Authority delivers to the Bank of Canada payment in full of the outstanding balance of the indebtedness of the credit union secured by the agreement. O. Reg. 181/19, s. 15 (2). (5) A guarantee of payment made under subparagraph ii or iii of paragraph 2 of subsection (4) must provide the following: 1. The Authority shall pay the outstanding balance of the indebtedness, including interest at the interest rate provided for in the debt instrument that forms a part of the security agreement prior to any default under that instrument, by the fifth anniversary of the guarantee, or such earlier date as the Chief Executive Officer may designate. 2. The secured party is not required to exhaust its right to recourse against the credit union or any other person before being entitled to payment or performance by the Authority under the guarantee. 3.

Reg. 181/19, s. 31 (1). (2) The Authority shall determine the differential premium score of each credit union and league in accordance with subsection (4.3) and with the rules set out in the Differential Premium Score Determination published by the Authority in The Ontario Gazette, as it may be amended from time to time. O. Reg. 181/19, s. 31 (2). (3) Revoked: O. Reg. 444/17, s. 1 (1). (4) Revoked: O. Reg. 120/14, s. 1 (2). (4.1), (4.2) Revoked: O. Reg. 444/17, s. 1 (1). (4.3) The differential premium score of a credit union or league at a particular time is determined with reference to the following components: 1. Capital: the level of regulatory capital of the credit union or league. 2. Corporate governance: the effectiveness of the governance practices of the credit union or league, as determined with reference to the Act and the Authority rules or by-laws. O. Reg. 120/14, s. 1 (5); O. Reg. 181/19, s. 31 (3). (4.4) The annual premium payable by a credit union or league for a financial year that begins on or after January 1, 2015 but before January 1, 2020 is calculated as follows: 1. If the differential premium score of a credit union or league is 90 or over, its annual premium is $1.00 per $1,000 of the funds described in subsection (5) for a credit union and in subsection (6) for a league. 2. If the differential premium score of a credit union or league is 0, its annual premium is $3.00 per $1,000 of those funds. 3. If the differential premium score of a credit union or league is between 0 and 90, its annual premium is the rate per $1,000 of those funds calculated using the formula, A = $1.75 – [B / 90 × $0.75] in which, “A” is the rate, and “B” is the credit union or league’s differential premium score. O. Reg. 120/14, s. 1 (5); O. Reg. 181/19, s. 31 (4).

If the differential premium score of a credit union or league is 0, its annual premium is $2.25 per $1,000 of those funds. 3. If the differential premium score of a credit union or league is between 0 and 90, its annual premium is the rate per $1,000 of those funds calculated using the formula, A = 0.75($1.75 – (B / 90 × $0.75)) in which, “A” is the rate, and “B” is the credit union or league’s differential premium score. O. Reg. 181/19, s. 31 (5).

O. Reg. 237/09, s. 105 (5). (6) The calculation of the annual premium for a league is based on Canadian funds on deposit with the league for a person that is not a credit union, and no premium is payable with respect to that portion of a deposit that is uninsured by virtue of section 270 of the Act.  O. Reg. 237/09, s. 105 (6). (7) The Authority may estimate the amount of funds on deposit with the credit union or league using the quarterly financial return of the credit union or league and may adjust the premium upon receiving the audited financial statements.  O. Reg. 237/09, s. 105 (7); O. Reg. 181/19, s. 31 (6). (8) The annual premium payable by a credit union or league that carries on business for less than one year shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the period during which it did not carry on business.
