The board shall make the payment into the account no later than December 31, 2013. 6. If, as of August 31, 2012, the employee has accumulated a retirement gratuity (other than one in the form of an early retirement incentive plan or a contribution to a registered retirement savings plan) but if the employee is not eligible to receive the retirement gratuity for the sole reason that he or she has not satisfied an eligibility requirement relating to the number of years of his or her service as an employee with the board, the employee is eligible to receive, by June 30, 2013, the following amount for gratuity wind-up: i. If the employment contract that was in effect on August 31, 2012 or a board policy that was in effect on that date provided for a payment for such a retirement gratuity, the amount that is the lesser of, A. the amount of the payment that would be provided under the employment contract or board policy, calculated using the number of years of his or her service as an employee with the board as of August 31, 2012 and, if the retirement gratuity is in the form of sick leave credits, using the number of days of sick leave credits accumulated by the employee as of August 31, 2012, and B. the amount calculated using the formula in subparagraph ii. ii. In any other case, the amount calculated using the formula, (X/30) × (Y/200) × (Z/10) in which, “X” is the number of years of his or her service as an employee with the board as of August 31, 2012, “Y” is the lesser of 200 and the number of days of sick leave credits accumulated by the employee as of August 31, 2012, and “Z” is the employee’s salary as of August 31, 2012. 7. If the employee retires before September 1, 2013, the following apply with respect to the employee’s retirement benefits: i. Any entitlement that the employee has to pay into a plan for health and dental benefits or life insurance after retiring shall be an entitlement to pay into the plan that, on August 31, 2012, the employment contract entitled the employee to pay into. ii. After the employee retires, the board will only make contributions into the plan referred to in subparagraph i for the employee if, on August 31, 2012, the employment contract provided for such contributions by the board. 8. If the employee retires on or after September 1, 2013, the following apply with respect to the employee’s retirement benefits: i. Any entitlement that the employee has to pay into a plan for health and dental benefits or life insurance after retiring shall be an entitlement to pay into a plan that is separate from the plan paid into by individuals who at that time are current employees of the board. ii.

Despite subparagraphs ii and iii, if, on August 31, 2012, the maternity benefits that the class of employees was entitled to receive were greater than the benefits set out in those subparagraphs, the employee is eligible to receive those benefits. 10. The employee’s entitlement to receive an amount to top up benefits that he or she is entitled to under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997 is as follows: i. The employee is only entitled to receive the top-up amount if the employee is in a class of employees that, on August 31, 2012, was entitled to use unused sick leave credits for the purpose of topping up benefits received under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997. ii. The top-up amount shall be paid for a maximum of four years and six months. iii.

The principal or vice-principal must take three unpaid days of leave on professional activity days in the 2013-2014 school year. 2. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on the first school day of a school year, the movement will occur on the 97th school day of the school year. 3. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on the anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board, the movement will occur on the 97th school day after that day. 4. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on a day other than a day described in paragraph 2 or 3, the movement will occur on the day that is six months after the day specified in the contract. O. Reg. 2/13, s. 2 (3); O. Reg. 12/13, s. 1 (6). (4) An employment contract between a board and a board employee that provides for an annual salary that is less than $100,000, and provides for movement on the salary grid, shall contain the following terms: 1. The employee must take one unpaid day of leave on a professional activity day in the 2013-2014 school year. 2. The following rules apply if, during a fiscal year, the employee’s period of employment is the same as the school year: i. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on the first school day of the school year, the movement will occur on the 97th school day of the school year. ii. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on the anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board, the movement will occur on the 97th school day after that day. iii. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on a day (the “designated day”) other than the first school day of the school year or the first anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board, the movement will occur on the 97th school day after that designated day. iv. If the contract provides for movement more than once in a fiscal year, the movement will occur on the day determined under paragraph 5. 3. The following rules apply if, during a fiscal year, the employee’s period of employment is not the same as the school year: i. Postponement period: For the purposes of subparagraphs ii, iii and iv, the employee’s postponement period is the number of days that is calculated by dividing by two the number of days in the employee’s period of employment during the fiscal year. If this calculation results in a number that includes a fraction of a day, increase this number of days to the next highest whole number. ii. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on the first school day of the school year, the movement will occur on the day after the postponement period expires. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the postponement period commences on the first school day of the school year. iii. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on the anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board, the movement will occur on the day after the postponement period expires. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the postponement period commences on the anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board. iv. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid on a day (the “designated day”) other than the first school day of the school year or the anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board, the movement will occur on the day after the postponement period expires. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the postponement period commences on the designated day. v. If the contract provides for movement more than once in a fiscal year, the movement will occur on the day determined under paragraph 5. 4.  Revoked: O. Reg. 12/13, s. 1 (7). 5. If the contract provides for movement on the salary grid more than once in a fiscal year, each movement will occur on the day that is the number of months determined using the following formula after the day specified in the contract: A/(1 + B) in which, “A” is the number of months that the employee is scheduled to work in the fiscal year, without deducting vacation days or statutory holidays, and “B” is the number of times in the fiscal year that movement on the salary grid is provided for in the contract. 6. On the last day of the restraint period, the employee shall be paid the amount, if any, determined in accordance with the following rules: i. Actual salary increase during restraint period: Calculate the amount by which the employee’s salary, at the end of the restraint period, had increased as a result of his or her movement on the salary grid during the restraint period. ii. Potential salary increase: Calculate the amount by which the employee’s salary, at the end of the restraint period, would have increased as a result of his or her movement on the salary grid during the restraint period, determined as if paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 did not apply in the circumstances. iii. Difference: Subtract the actual salary increase calculated under subparagraph i from the potential salary increase calculated under subparagraph ii, and express the resulting amount as a percentage of the potential salary increase. iv. Amount of payment: If the percentage calculated under subparagraph iii is greater than 50 per cent, the amount payable to the employee under this paragraph is calculated using the formula, (C − D) × E in which, “C” is the percentage calculated under subparagraph iii, “D” is 50 per cent, and “E” is the amount of the potential salary increase calculated under subparagraph ii. v. No payment: If the percentage calculated under subparagraph iii is 50 per cent or less, no amount is payable to the employee under this paragraph. O. Reg. 2/13, s. 2 (4); O. Reg. 12/13, s. 1 (7-9). (5) If an employment contract between a board and a board employee provides for movement on the salary grid, the contract is exempt from the application of paragraph 10 of subsection 2 (1) of the Act and instead shall contain the following term: 1. The employee shall be eligible for an additional 120 days of sick leave during a board’s fiscal year paid at a rate of pay equal to, i. 90 per cent of the employee’s salary for the year, if the employee’s entitlement to that rate has been determined through an adjudicative process agreed to by the employee and the board, or ii. 66.67 per cent of the employee’s salary for the year, for all other employees. O. Reg. 2/13, s. 2 (5). (6) If, on August 31, 2012, an employment contract between a board and a board employee did not provide for sick leave, the contract is exempt from the application of paragraphs 9 and 10 of subsection 2 (1) of the Act and, in that case, subsection (5) does not apply. O. Reg. 2/13, s. 2 (6). (7) If, on August 31, 2012, an employment contract between a board and a board employee entitled the employee to an increase in vacation time, including payment in lieu of vacation time, based on the employee’s years of experience, the following apply: 1. The contract is exempt from the application of paragraph 4 of subsection 2 (1) of the Act to the extent that it prohibits such an increase. 2.

If, as of August 31, 2012, the employee has accumulated a retirement gratuity (other than one in the form of an early retirement incentive plan or a contribution to a registered retirement savings plan) but if the employee is not eligible to receive the retirement gratuity for the sole reason that he or she has not satisfied an eligibility requirement relating to the number of years of his or her service as an employee with the board, the employee is eligible to receive, by June 30, 2013, the following amount for gratuity wind-up: i. If the collective agreement that was in effect on August 31, 2012 or a board policy that was in effect on that date provided for a payment for such a retirement gratuity, the amount that is the lesser of, A. the amount of the payment that would be provided under the collective agreement or board policy, calculated using the number of years of his or her service as an employee with the board as of August 31, 2012 and, if the retirement gratuity is in the form of sick leave credits, using the number of days of sick leave credits accumulated by the employee as of August 31, 2012, and B. the amount calculated using the formula in subparagraph ii. ii.

Postponement period: For the purposes of subparagraphs ii, iii, iv and v, the employee’s postponement period is the number of days calculated by dividing by two the number of days in the employee’s period of employment during the fiscal year. If this calculation results in a number that includes a fraction of a day, increase this number of days to the next highest whole number.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. If the collective agreement provides for movement on the salary grid on the first school day of the school year, the movement will occur on the day after the postponement period expires. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the postponement period commences on the first school day of the school year.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iii. If the collective agreement provides for movement on the salary grid on the anniversary of the first day the employee was employed by the board, the movement will occur on the day after the postponement period expires.

For the purposes of this subparagraph, the postponement period commences on the designated day.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  vi. If the collective agreement provides for movement more than once in a fiscal year, the movement will occur on the day determined under paragraph 6.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  4.

If the collective agreement provides for movement on the salary grid, the employee shall be paid the amount, if any, determined in accordance with the following rules, and the amount is payable on the last day of the restraint period:</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i. Actual salary increase during restraint period: Calculate the amount by which the employee’s salary, at the end of the restraint period, had increased as a result of his or her movement on the salary grid during the restraint period.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. Potential salary increase: Calculate the amount by which the employee’s salary, at the end of the restraint period, would have increased as a result of his or her movement on the salary grid during the restraint period, determined as if paragraphs 2, 3 and 6 did not apply in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iii. Difference: Subtract the actual salary increase calculated under subparagraph i from the potential salary increase calculated under subparagraph ii, and express the resulting amount as a percentage of the potential salary increase.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iv. Amount of payment: If the percentage calculated under subparagraph iii is greater than 50 per cent, the amount payable to the employee under this paragraph is calculated using the formula,</p> <p class=\"equation-e\">(C − D) × E</p> <p class=\"Ssubpara-e\">in which,</p> <p class=\"equationind3-e\">  “C” is the percentage calculated under subparagraph iii,</p> <p class=\"equationind3-e\">  “D” is 50 per cent, and</p> <p class=\"equationind3-e\">  “E” is the amount of the potential salary increase calculated under subparagraph ii.</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  v. No payment: If the percentage calculated under subparagraph iii is 50 per cent or less, no amount is payable to the employee under this paragraph. O. Reg. 2/13, s. 3 (2); O. Reg. 12/13, s. 2 (7-9).</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\"><b> </b>(3) For the purposes of paragraph 3 of subsection 4 (1) of the Act, the following is prescribed as a term that is to be included in a collective agreement between a board listed in subsection (4) and an employee bargaining agent:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1.
