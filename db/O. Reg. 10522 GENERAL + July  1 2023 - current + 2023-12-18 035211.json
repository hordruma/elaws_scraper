(2) The Authority shall determine the differential premium score of each credit union and central in accordance with subsection (3) and with the rules set out in the Differential Premium Score Determination published by the Authority on the Authority’s website, as it may be amended from time to time. (3) The differential premium score of a credit union or central at a particular time is determined with reference to the following components: 1. Capital: the level of regulatory capital of a credit union or central. 2. Corporate governance: the effectiveness of the governance practices of the credit union or central, as determined with reference to the Act and the Authority rules. (4) The annual premium payable by a credit union or central for a financial year that begins on or after January 1, 2022 is calculated as follows: 1. If the differential premium score of a credit union or central is 90 or over, its annual premium is $0.75 per $1,000 of the funds described in subsection (5) for a credit union and in subsection (6) for a central. 2. If the differential premium score of a credit union or central is 0, its annual premium is $2.25 per $1,000 of those funds. 3. If the differential premium score of the credit union or central is between 0 and 90, its annual premium is the rate per $1,000 of those funds calculated using the formula, A = 0.75 ($1.75 – [B / 90 × $0.75]) in which, “A” is the rate, and “B” is the credit union or central’s differential premium score. (5) The calculation of the annual premium for a credit union is based on Canadian funds on deposit with the credit union, and no premium is payable with respect to that portion of a deposit that is uninsured by virtue of section 218 of the Act. (6) The calculation of the annual premium for a central is based on Canadian funds on deposit with the central for a person that is not a credit union, and no premium is payable with respect to that portion of a deposit that is uninsured by virtue of section 218 of the Act. (7) The Authority may estimate the amount of funds on deposit with the credit union or central using the quarterly financial return of the credit union or central and may adjust the premium upon receiving the audited financial statements. (8) The annual premium payable by a credit union or central that carries on business for less than one year shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the period during which it did not carry on business. (9) Despite subsections (4) and (8), the minimum annual premium payable by a credit union or central is $250.
