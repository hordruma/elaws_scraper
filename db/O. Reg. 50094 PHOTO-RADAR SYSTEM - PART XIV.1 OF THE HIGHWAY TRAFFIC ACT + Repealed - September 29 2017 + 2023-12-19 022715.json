(2) A photo-radar system is a device that, (a) calculates in kilometres per hour the rate of speed at which a subject motor vehicle is being driven by measuring the relative movement between the device and the subject motor vehicle; (b) takes a photograph of the subject motor vehicle, whether or not other vehicles are in the camera’s field of view, at the moment of calculation of the rate of speed at which the subject motor vehicle is being driven; (c) shows or superimposes on the photograph the rate of speed at which the subject motor vehicle is being driven, together with the date and time at which the photograph is taken and the rate of speed calculated.  O. Reg. 500/94, s. 1 (2). (3) A photograph obtained through the use of a photo-radar system may show or have superimposed on it information in addition to that referred to in clause (2) (c), but the inclusion or omission of such additional information does not prevent the photograph from being used for its intended purpose under this or any other Act.  O. Reg. 500/94, s. 1 (3). (4) The following device constitutes a photo-radar system: 1. Gatsometer Gatso Radar Type 24 with traffic camera types AUS or AUS-D for mobile and stationary controls.  O.
