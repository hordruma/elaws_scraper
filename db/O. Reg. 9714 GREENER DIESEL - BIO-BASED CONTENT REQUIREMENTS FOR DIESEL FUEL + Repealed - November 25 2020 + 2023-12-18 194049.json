(1.2) For the purposes of the definition of “bio-based content” in subsection (1), bio-based content does not include biological matter derived from the biogenic carbon component of solid municipal waste that contains, (a) source separated organics, except for residues generated by the processing of the waste; (b) compost produced by composting; (c) anaerobic digestion output; or (d) leaf and yard waste collected or accepted by a leaf and yard waste system to which section 13 of Ontario Regulation 101/94 (Recycling and Composting of Municipal Waste) made under the Act applies, except for residues generated by the composting of the waste at a leaf and yard waste composting site as defined in Part V of that Regulation. O. Reg. 226/18, s. 2 (12). (2) For the purposes of this Regulation, a volume of diesel or blended diesel is “placed in the Ontario market” if a fuel supplier, (a) manufactured and used it or sold it, at wholesale or retail, in Ontario; (b) imported it and used it or sold it, at wholesale or retail, in Ontario; or (c) acquired it in Ontario through an inter-refiner agreement and used it or sold it, at wholesale or retail, in Ontario. O. Reg. 97/14, s. 1 (2); O. Reg. 226/18, s. 2 (13).

Reg. 97/14, s. 1 (3); O. Reg. 226/18, s. 2 (13). (4) For the purposes of any calculations under this Regulation, if a volume of diesel or blended diesel is placed in the Ontario market more than once, only the fuel supplier that first placed it in the Ontario market shall account for it.
