(1) This section applies if the family law valuation date is a date that falls on or before the earliest date on which a member would have been eligible, or would have been deemed to have been eligible in accordance with subsection (4) or (5), to be paid an unreduced pension under the pension plan.  O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (1). (2) The preliminary value of a member’s pension benefits that are defined benefits is determined using the following formulas, in which “A”, “B”, “C” and “T” have the meanings assigned by subsection (3): 1.  If “T” for the member is at least zero but less than 10, (0.1T/10) × A + [(4 − 0.04T)/10] × B + [(6 − 0.06T)/10] × C 2.

If “T” for the member is 30 or more, (0.85 × A) + (0.06 × B) + (0.09 × C) O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (2). (3) In the formulas used in subsection (2), “A”  is the commuted value of the member’s accrued pension benefits, (a)  determined as if the member had terminated employment or membership in the plan on the family law valuation date, (b)  determined in accordance with the terms of the pension plan on the family law valuation date and without consideration of future salary, benefits or changes to the plan and regardless of whether the member’s entitlement to the pension benefits is vested under the plan on the family law valuation date, (c)  determined assuming that if, as of the family law valuation date, the member has met all eligibility requirements under the plan necessary to choose one or more dates on which he or she may commence a pension, the member will choose the date that results in a pension with the greatest commuted value, and (d)  adjusted to include the commuted value of any ancillary benefits for which, as of the family law valuation date, the member has met all eligibility requirements under the plan necessary to exercise the right to receive the benefit; “B”  is the commuted value of the member’s accrued pension benefits, (a)  determined as if the member had terminated employment or membership in the plan on the family law valuation date, (b)  determined in accordance with the terms of the pension plan on the family law valuation date and without consideration of future salary, benefits or changes to the plan and regardless of whether the member’s entitlement to the pension benefits is vested under the plan on the family law valuation date, and (c)  determined assuming that the member’s pension will commence at the normal retirement date under the terms of the plan; “C”  is the commuted value of the member’s accrued pension benefits, (a)  determined as if the member had terminated employment or membership in the plan on the family law valuation date, (b)  determined in accordance with the terms of the pension plan on the family law valuation date and without consideration of future salary, benefits or changes to the plan and regardless of whether the member’s entitlement to the pension benefits is vested under the plan on the family law valuation date, and (c)  determined assuming that the member’s pension will commence, without reduction, (i)  at the earliest date at which he or she would be eligible, without the administrator’s or employer’s consent, to be paid an unreduced pension if his or her employment or membership in the plan continued on the same terms to that date, or (ii)  if the administrator’s or employer’s consent is an eligibility requirement for the member’s entitlement to be paid an unreduced pension, at the earliest date at which the member would be eligible, with the administrator’s or employer’s deemed consent as described in subsection (4) or (5), to be paid an unreduced pension if his or her employment or membership in the plan continued on the same terms to that date, and (d)  if the plan provides bridging benefits, adjusted to include the commuted value of the bridging benefits as determined in accordance with subsection (6); and “T”  is the number of years during the period that begins on the member’s family law valuation date and ends on the earliest date on which the member would be eligible, or would be deemed in accordance with subsection (4) or (5) to be eligible, to be paid an unreduced pension under the pension plan if his or her employment or membership in the plan continued on the same terms to that date.  O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (3). (4) For the variables “C” and “T” in subsection (3), if the administrator’s or employer’s consent is an eligibility requirement for an unreduced pension before the normal retirement date and if the administrator or employer is otherwise deemed to have consented for any other purpose under the Act, the administrator or employer is also deemed to have consented for the purposes of the preliminary valuation.  O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (4). (5) For the variables “C” and “T” in subsection (3), if the administrator’s consent is an eligibility requirement for an unreduced pension before the normal retirement date and if the administrator is not otherwise deemed to have consented for any other purpose under the Act, the administrator is deemed to have consented for the purposes of the preliminary valuation if the following condition is satisfied: 1.  The member would meet all of the other eligibility requirements for his or her entitlement to be paid the unreduced pension, if he or she continues his or her employment or membership in the pension plan on the same terms to the earliest date on which the unreduced pension could commence.  O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (5). (6) For the variable “C” in subsection (3), if the member would be entitled to bridging benefits when payment of the unreduced pension begins, the variable “C” includes the commuted value of the bridging benefits, (a)  as accrued for service up to the family law valuation date and as payable from the earliest date on which the member would be eligible to be paid the unreduced pension, in the case of bridging benefits determined with reference to the length of the member’s service; or (b)  as prorated by the ratio that the member’s actual period of employment or membership in the plan up to the family law valuation date bears to the period of employment or membership that would end on the earliest date on which the member would be eligible to be paid the unreduced pension and full bridging benefits, in the case of bridging benefits that are not determined with reference to the length of the member’s service.  O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (6). (7) For the variable “T” in subsection (3), the number of years during the specified period must include one-twelfth of a year for each full month during the period.  O. Reg. 287/11, s. 6 (7).

O. Reg. 287/11, s. 28 (2).

The same restrictions that apply under subsections 19 (2), (3) and (6) to (7.2) of the General Regulation with respect to the transfer of the commuted value of the member’s pension benefits or the former member’s deferred pension, as the case may be, also apply with necessary modifications with respect to the transfer of a lump sum under section 67.3 of the Act. 2.

O. Reg. 287/11, s. 28 (4).
