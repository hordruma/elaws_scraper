A, s. 44 (7).

H, s. 16. Disclosure under other Acts (9) Despite any other Act that permits a health information custodian to disclose personal health information to a researcher for the purpose of conducting research, this section applies to the disclosure as if it were a disclosure for research under this section unless the regulations made under this Act provide otherwise.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 44 (9). Research approved outside Ontario (10) Subject to subsection (11), a health information custodian may disclose personal health information to a researcher or may use the information to conduct research if, (a)  the research involves the use of personal health information originating wholly or in part outside Ontario; (b)  the research has received the prescribed approval from a body outside Ontario that has the function of approving research; and (c)  the prescribed requirements are met.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 44 (10).

A, s. 54 (1); 2007, c. 10, Sched. H, s. 20 (1, 2). Providing reasons (1.1) A custodian acting under clause (1) (d) shall not act under subclause (1) (d) (i) where doing so would reasonably be expected in the circumstances known to the person making the decision on behalf of the custodian to reveal to the individual, directly or indirectly, information to which the individual does not have a right of access.  2007, c. 10, Sched. H, s. 20 (3).

A, s. 54 (2). Extension of time for response (3) Within 30 days after receiving the request for access, the health information custodian may extend the time limit set out in subsection (2) for a further period of time of not more than 30 days if, (a)  meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the custodian because the information consists of numerous pieces of information or locating the information would necessitate a lengthy search; or (b)  the time required to undertake the consultations necessary to reply to the request within 30 days after receiving it would make it not reasonably practical to reply within that time.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (3). Notice of extension (4) Upon extending the time limit under subsection (3), the health information custodian shall give the individual written notice of the extension setting out the length of the extension and the reason for the extension.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (4). Expedited access (5) Despite subsection (2), the health information custodian shall give the response required by clause (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d) within the time period that the individual specifies if, (a)  the individual provides the custodian with evidence satisfactory to the custodian, acting on a reasonable basis, that the individual requires access to the requested record of personal health information on an urgent basis within that time period; and (b)  the custodian is reasonably able to give the required response within that time period.  2004, c. 3, Sched.

A, s. 54 (6). Effect of non-compliance (7) If the health information custodian does not respond to the request within the time limit or before the extension, if any, expires, the custodian shall be deemed to have refused the individual’s request for access.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (7).

A, s. 54 (8). Identity of individual (9) A health information custodian shall not make a record of personal health information or a part of it available to an individual under this Part or provide a copy of it to an individual under clause (1) (a) without first taking reasonable steps to be satisfied as to the individual’s identity.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (9). Fee for access (10) A health information custodian that makes a record of personal health information or a part of it available to an individual under this Part or provides a copy of it to an individual under clause (1) (a) may charge the individual a fee for that purpose if the custodian first gives the individual an estimate of the fee.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 54 (10). Amount of fee (11) The amount of the fee shall not exceed the prescribed amount or the amount of reasonable cost recovery, if no amount is prescribed.  2004, c. 3, Sched.
