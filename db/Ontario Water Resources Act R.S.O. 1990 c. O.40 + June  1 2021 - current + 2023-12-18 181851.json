Exceptions (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to, (a)  a contravention of subsection 30 (1), if, (i)  neither this Act nor the Environmental Protection Act requires the regulated person to notify the Ministry of the discharge to which the contravention relates, or (ii)  the discharge to which the contravention relates was authorized under this Act or the Environmental Protection Act; or (b)  a contravention of section 98.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Contents of order (3) The order shall be served on the person who is required to pay the penalty and shall, (a)  contain a description of the contravention to which the order relates, including, where appropriate, the date and location of the contravention; (b)  in the case of a contravention of subsection 30 (1), contain a description of how the contravention may impair the quality of the water of any waters; (c)  specify the amount of the penalty; (d)  give particulars respecting the time for paying the penalty and the manner of payment; and (e)  provide information to the person as to the person’s rights under section 100.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28); 2007, c. 10, Sched.

Absolute liability (6) A requirement that a person pay an environmental penalty applies even if, (a)  the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention; or (b)  at the time of the contravention, the person had an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts that, if true, would have rendered the contravention innocent.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Same (7) For greater certainty, nothing in subsection (6) affects the prosecution of an offence.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Limitation (8) An order requiring payment of an environmental penalty shall be served not later than the first anniversary of the later of the following dates: 1.  The date the contravention occurred. 2.  The date on which the evidence of the contravention first came to the attention of the Director or a provincial officer.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Agreements (9) The Director and a person against whom an order may be or has been made under subsection (1) may enter into an agreement that, (a)  identifies the contravention in respect of which the order may be or has been made; (b)  requires the person against whom the order may be or has been made to take steps specified in the agreement within the time specified in the agreement; and (c)  provides that the obligation to pay the penalty may be cancelled in accordance with the regulations or the amount of the penalty may be reduced in accordance with the regulations.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Publication of agreements (10) The Ministry shall publish every agreement entered into under subsection (9) in the environmental registry established under section 5 of the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Penalty does not prevent prosecution (11) A person may be charged, prosecuted and convicted of an offence under this Act in respect of a contravention referred to in subsection (1) even if an environmental penalty has been imposed on or paid by the person or another person in respect of the contravention.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). No admission (12) If a person pays a penalty imposed under subsection (1) in respect of a contravention or enters into an agreement under subsection (9) in respect of a contravention, the payment or entering into of the agreement is not, for the purposes of any prosecution in respect of the contravention, an admission that the person committed the contravention.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Failure to pay when required (13) If a person who is required to pay an environmental penalty fails to comply with the requirement, (a)  the order or decision that requires the payment may be filed with a local registrar of the Superior Court of Justice and may be enforced as if it were an order of the court; (b)  the Director may by order suspend any licence, permit or approval that has been issued to the person under this Act until the environmental penalty is paid; and (c)  the Director may refuse to issue any licence, permit or approval to the person under this Act until the environmental penalty is paid.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28).
