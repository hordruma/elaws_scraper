Same (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the municipality shall, between 14 and 180 days after voting day, (a)  if a by-law or resolution is required to implement the results of the question, ensure that it is prepared and placed before council or, if a series of by-laws are required to implement the results, ensure that the first of the series is prepared and placed before council; (b)  despite clause (a), if passage of a by-law or resolution required to implement the results of the question is subject to a condition precedent under a regulation or statute (such as giving notice or holding a public hearing), ensure the initial steps have been taken to comply with the condition; (c)  if administrative action to change a policy or practice is required to implement the results of the question, instruct municipal staff to take that action. 2000, c. 5, s. 28. Limitation (3) For the purpose of clause (1) (a), it is not within the jurisdiction of the municipality to eliminate or override any substantive or procedural legal right of any person or entity who is or may be affected by the implementation of the results of the question as illustrated by the following examples: 1.  If a zoning change under the Planning Act is necessary to implement the results, the binding effect of the question is subject to the Planning Act\r\nand the discretion of the municipality under that Act is not constrained.  If the zoning change is approved, the municipality is bound to implement the results; if it is not approved, the municipality is not bound. 2.  If the results of the question require the passage of a by-law which requires notice to be given and at least one public meeting to be held to consider the matter before the by-law is passed, the binding effect of the question is subject to these procedural requirements and the discretion of the municipality to proceed following the public meeting is not constrained.
