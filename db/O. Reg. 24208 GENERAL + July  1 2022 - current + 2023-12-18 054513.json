The person shall ensure that all reasonable steps are taken during the following periods of time in order to avoid spreading diseases and pests to, or compromising the genetic integrity of, the member of the species that is the object of the stewardship activity and any of the member’s progeny that resulted while in the person’s possession: i. in the case of a member of the species that the person is required to be in their possession for more than seven days, during the entire time the member and its progeny are in the person’s possession, or ii. in the case of a member of the species that is required to be released into an area other than the area from which it was captured or taken, during the release of the member. 3. The person shall ensure that any member of a species that is the object of the stewardship activity and is required to be in their possession for more than seven days, and any of the member’s progeny that resulted while in the person’s possession, is maintained in a manner that supports the health and viability of the member of the species and its progeny for as long as they remain in the person’s possession. 4. During a stewardship activity that involves the release of a member of a species that is the object of the activity, and any of its progeny that resulted while in the person’s possession, into an area other than the area from which it was captured or taken, the person shall ensure that, so long as the activity continues, reasonable steps are taken to manage the habitat of the species in that area in a manner that supports the necessary life processes of the member, and any of its progeny, that are released. 5. The person shall ensure that, so long as the stewardship activity continues, all reasonable steps are taken to promote the genetic integrity and health of each member of the species that is the object of the activity and of the member’s progeny that resulted while the member was in the person’s possession. 6. The stewardship activity must be carried out by or under the supervision of a person with expertise in relation to the species that is the object of the activity. 7. The person shall not release a member of the species that is the object of the stewardship activity, or the progeny that resulted while the member was in the person’s possession, to an area or in a manner that would pose a significant risk to the member, its progeny or to any other members of the species.

O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 179/14, s. 2 (4, 5); O. Reg. 831/21, s. 7. (9) The following are the steps that a person must take to minimize the adverse effects of the activity described in the notice of activity form on the species identified in the form: 1. The person must not carry out any part of the activity that is likely to kill, harm or harass a member of the species or damage or destroy the habitat of the species while the species is likely to be carrying out a life process related to reproduction, including rearing. 2. The person must isolate the work area within the watercourse in a manner that prevents members of the species from entering the work area, and must relocate any fishes or mussels from within the work area to suitable habitat for the species. 3. If the activity will take place in the habitat of a mussel species identified in Columns 3 and 4 of the Table to this section, any relocation of mussels must be carried out in accordance with the requirements for mussel relocation described in the document entitled “Protocol for the detection and relocation of freshwater mussel species at risk in Ontario-Great Lakes Area (OGLA)”, dated 2008, a Canadian Manuscript Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 2790, published by Fisheries and Oceans Canada and available on the Fisheries and Oceans Canada website. 4. No vehicles or machinery may enter the watercourse at any time, except in an area of the watercourse in which the species have been isolated and from which they have been relocated in accordance with paragraph 2, and after the area has been de-watered. 5. The flow of the watercourse that is redirected around the work area must be maintained to ensure that water quantity and quality is not affected downstream of the activity. 6. If the activity involves the maintenance, repair, modification, expansion or replacement of an open-bottom culvert, the culvert must remain as an open-bottom culvert or may be converted to a clear span bridge. 7. If the activity involves the construction, maintenance, repair, modification, or expansion of a pipeline or conduit under the watercourse, i. the activity must not take place in an area that a fish species uses to carry out a life process related to reproduction, including rearing, ii. the activity must be conducted using trenchless techniques, which must be applied at a minimum of two metres below the bed of the watercourse, iii. no part of the activity may be conducted in the watercourse and there must be no damage to the watercourse bed or banks as a result of the activity, iv. bore pits for directional drilling must be located outside the floodplain and bore pits for other trenchless techniques must be located a minimum of five metres outside of the bankfull width, and must include the appropriate erosion and sediment controls, as set out in paragraph 11, and v. a contingency plan, including an emergency response plan to deal with a failure of the trenchless techniques referred to in subparagraph ii, must be prepared and all necessary equipment and materials to implement the plan must be available on site until the activity is complete. 8. All construction equipment used for the purpose of carrying out the activity must be operated in a way that minimizes adverse effects on the habitat of the species and prevents deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. 9. No machinery or equipment may be maintained or refuelled within 30 metres of the watercourse. 10. Any equipment, stockpiled material or construction material must be stored a minimum distance of 30 metres from the habitat of the species and in a manner that prevents sediment or deleterious substances from entering the habitat of the species. 11. The person must establish and maintain sediment and erosion control measures, which must include installing and maintaining a double row of sediment control fencing consisting of a non-woven material with staked straw bales, to prevent sediment from entering any part of the watercourse. 12. Any water that is laden with sediment that the person proposes to discharge must be filtered to remove the sediment before it enters any part of the watercourse. 13. Riparian areas that are damaged during the activity must be restored to provide suitable conditions for the species, by stabilizing exposed soils and planting native non-invasive plants, as soon as possible after the area is damaged. 14. If the person discovers that steps described in paragraphs 1 to 13 or in the mitigation plan have not been effective in minimizing the adverse effects of the activity on the species or that the action completed to benefit the species under paragraph 8 of subsection (6) has not been effective, the person shall take such actions as are necessary to increase their effectiveness, including, i. adjusting the sediment and erosion control measures, ii. installing tree guards or wire mesh to protect trees or shrubs, iii. replacing dead plants, and iv. repairing areas that have suffered due to failed sediment and erosion control measures. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 179/14, s. 2 (6). (10) The monitoring required by paragraph 6 of subsection (6) must include, (a) daily inspections of the activity site while the activity and the action for the benefit of the species required under paragraph 8 of subsection (6) are being carried out; and (b) annual inspections of the activity site for a period of five years after the activity is completed. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (11) For the purposes of paragraph 8 of subsection (6), the following are the actions that a person may complete in order to provide a benefit to the species identified in the notice of activity form: 1. Remediation of an area of degraded riparian habitat to create the conditions that are required by the species adversely affected by the activity, which may include bank stabilization and riparian planting, if, i. the area is in a degraded state prior to the activity taking place, and ii. the area of degraded riparian habitat is at least two times the size of the total area that is adversely affected by the activity, including the areas that are both in the watercourse and adjacent to the watercourse. 2. Improvement of an existing storm water management facility, by planting native non-invasive plants that will shade the storm water management pond, in order to reduce the water temperature and improve the quality of water being discharged at the outlet of the facility and, in so doing, create the conditions that are required by the species adversely affected by the activity, if, i. the area is not adequately vegetated prior to the activity taking place, and ii. the area planted is at least two times the size of the total area that is adversely affected by the activity, including the areas that are both in the watercourse and adjacent to the watercourse. 3. Improvement of an existing storm water management facility, by installing a bottom draw outlet or a cooling trench to the facility, in order to reduce the temperature of water being discharged at the outlet of the facility and, in so doing, create the conditions that are required by the species adversely affected by the activity. 4. Remediation of an existing perched culvert to remove barriers to fish passage that exist in the watercourse and, in so doing, create the conditions that are required by the species adversely affected by the activity. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (12) The requirement in paragraph 8 of subsection (6) to complete an action described in subsection (11) in order to provide a benefit to the species identified in the notice of activity form does not apply if the activity identified in the notice of activity form is the replacement of a closed-bottom culvert with an open-bottom culvert or a clear span bridge. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (13) The monitoring record required under paragraph 7 of subsection (6) shall, (a) document the data and information collected during monitoring conducted at the site, such as the effectiveness of erosion control measures and the growing progress of riparian plantings; (b) evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of the steps taken by the person to minimize adverse effects of the activity on the species identified in the notice of activity form; (c) evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of the action completed under paragraph 8 of subsection (6) in order to provide a benefit to the species identified in the notice of activity form, such as the effectiveness of bank stabilization measures or the growing progress of riparian plantings; (d) document details of any encounters with members of the species identified in the notice of activity form; and (e) describe any measures that were followed during the course of carrying out the activity described in the notice of activity form or of the action that was completed under paragraph 8 of subsection (6) to increase the effectiveness of the steps taken to minimize the adverse effects of the activity or the effectiveness of the action completed under paragraph 8 of subsection (6).

            "content": " 23.8 (1) In this section, “chimney swift active season” means the period of each year when chimney swift carry out life processes relating to breeding, nesting, rearing and roosting, and that begins around the end of April and ends around the middle of October, the exact dates varying according to the area of the Province in which the chimney swift are located and the climate conditions of each year. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 308/16, s. 7 (1). (2) Clause 9 (1) (a) and subsection 10 (1) of the Act do not apply to a person who harms or harasses a chimney swift, or who damages or destroys its habitat, while carrying out the maintenance, repair, modification, replacement or demolition of a chimney that provides chimney swift habitat, if the person satisfies the conditions set out in subsections (3) to (11). O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (3) The conditions that a person must satisfy for the purposes of subsection (2) are as follows: 1. Before commencing an activity described in subsection (2), the person must, i. give the Minister notice of the activity by submitting a notice of activity form available on the Registry to the Minister through the Registry, ii. ensure that the notice includes, A. a description of the activity, B. the proposed start and end dates for the activity, C. the location of the chimney that will be the object of the activity, and D. notice of the fact that the activity will impact chimney swift, iii. prepare a chimney swift mitigation and restoration record in accordance with subsection (4). 2. The person must follow the requirements of section 23.3 with respect to the completion of the notice of activity form referred to in subparagraph 1 i, the keeping of records relating to the notice of activity form and the updating of the information on the Registry. 3. Before, during and after carrying out the activity described in subsection (2), the person must, i. follow the steps set out in subsections (5) to (7) to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on chimney swift and its habitat, and ii. update the chimney swift mitigation and restoration record to include the steps referred to in subparagraph i. 4. The person must carry out the monitoring and record keeping activities described in subsections (8) to (11). 5. Every year that the person is required to monitor chimney swift habitat under subsection (8), the person must notify the Ministry of chimney swift observed during monitoring by completing, within three months following the completion of the monitoring, the Ontario Species at Risk Observation Reporting Form available on a website maintained by the Government of Ontario detailing the species, number of chimney swifts, the date and location of observation and any other information requested on that form. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 218/18, s. 6; O. Reg. 831/21, s. 17. (4) A chimney swift mitigation and restoration record referred to in subparagraph 1 iii of subsection (3) shall, when first prepared, include the following information: 1. The name and contact information of the person who is proposing to carry out an activity described in subsection (2). 2. A description of the activity the person proposes to carry out, including the proposed start and completion dates. 3. A description of the chimney that will be affected by the activity, including the height, internal square footage and material. 4. An estimation of the number of chimney swift using the chimney. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (5) The following are the steps a person who proposes to carry out an activity described in subsection (2) must follow to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on chimney swift and its habitat: 1. If any part of the activity is to be carried out during the chimney swift active season, the person must take measures, such as capping the chimney, to prevent chimney swift from accessing the chimney that will be affected by the activity both before and during the chimney swift active season. 2. If, despite following the measures described in paragraph 1, chimney swift begin to use the chimney during their active season to breed, nest, rear or roost, any part of the activity that would affect the chimney must be suspended until the end of the chimney swift active season. 3. If, as a result of carrying out the activity, a chimney that provides habitat for chimney swift will be unavailable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting during the chimney swift active season, but will be available by the following chimney swift active season and will provide at least the same amount of suitable habitat for chimney swift at that time, the person must improve the conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting provided by the chimney by ensuring that the activity includes measures such as any of the following: i. increasing the height of the chimney, ii. installing a sun collar on the opening of the chimney, or iii. cutting back vegetation encroaching on the chimney’s opening. 4. The person must create new habitat for chimney swift in accordance with subsection (6) if, as a result of carrying out the activity, a chimney that provides habitat for chimney swift, i. will be destroyed, ii. will be altered so that it no longer provides suitable conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting or provides a smaller area for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, or iii. will be unavailable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting for more than one chimney swift active season. 5. The person must maintain habitat created under paragraph 4 for a period of three years after the habitat is created. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 308/16, s. 7 (2-5). (6) If a person is required to create new habitat for chimney swift under paragraph 4 of subsection (5), the habitat must be created as follows: 1. The habitat shall be created by either, i. constructing one or more new structures, which may or may not be chimneys, that provide appropriate conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, or ii. modifying one or more existing structures which may or may not be chimneys, that do not currently provide habitat for chimney swift to provide appropriate conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting. 2. The habitat must include features to attract chimney swift to the structure or to enhance the suitability of the structure for chimney swift, such as installing a sun collar at the opening of the chimney or planting native shrubs, trees or flowers to attract insects. 3. The structure that is constructed or modified must be located within two kilometres of the chimney that will be affected by the activity described in subsection (2) and must be capable of providing habitat for more chimney swifts than the chimney that was affected by the activity. 4. If a single structure is constructed or modified, the structure must be of a greater height and have greater internal square footage available to chimney swift than the chimney affected by the activity described in subsection (2), but must not be greater than one and a half times the size of the chimney affected by the activity. 5. If more than one structure is constructed or modified, one of the structures must be of at least the same height and have at least the same internal square footage available to chimney swift as the chimney affected by the activity described in subsection (2). 6. A structure must be constructed or modified so as to provide suitable conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, including the following: i. the structure must have a temperature range that is suitable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting during the chimney swift active season, ii. the opening of the structure must be accessible for chimney swift to enter and exit, iii. the interior surface of the structure must be composed of unpainted, rough-textured material such as brick or cinder block appropriate for clinging and nest adherence, iv. the interior dimensions of the structure must be suitable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, v. the height of the structure must be suitable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting having regard to the ground level, the roofline of associated structures and other structures or vegetation within reasonable proximity. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 308/16, s. 7 (6-9). (7) A person who proposes to carry out an activity described in subsection (2) and is required to create habitat for chimney swift under paragraph 4 of subsection (5) must do so within one of the following time frames: 1. If the activity will begin outside of the chimney swift active season, before the beginning of the next chimney swift active season. 2. If the activity will begin during the chimney swift active season, before the beginning of that chimney swift active season. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (8) After a person has created habitat for chimney swift under paragraph 4 of subsection (5), the person shall monitor the use of the habitat by chimney swift during the chimney swift active season for a period of years determined under subsection (9) and shall record information collected during monitoring, including the following information: 1. An estimate of the number of chimney swift entering or exiting the structure. 2. Evidence of chimney swift nesting in the structure. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (9) The number of years during which a person must monitor the effectiveness of habitat under subsection (8) shall be determined in accordance with the following rules: 1. If chimney swift are observed and recorded entering and exiting the structure during the first three years of monitoring, the person is not required to conduct further monitoring after the end of the three-year period. 2. If chimney swift are not observed and recorded entering and exiting the structure during the first three years of monitoring, the person shall continue to monitor the habitat until five years have passed after the creation of the habitat under paragraph 4 of subsection (5). O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (10) A person who carries out an activity described in subsection (2) shall retain the chimney swift mitigation and restoration record created under subsection (4) for a period of five years after the activity is completed and shall update the record from time to time to include the following information: 1. A description of the steps followed by the person in accordance with subsection (5) to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on chimney swift and its habitat, including the location, square footage and description of the habitat created under paragraph 4 of subsection (5) or improved under paragraph 3 of subsection (5). 2. The information recorded during monitoring activities described in subsection (8). 3. Any change to the information included in the record under subsection (4). O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (11) A person who carries out an activity described in subsection (2) shall provide a copy of the chimney swift mitigation and restoration record to the Ministry within 14 days of receiving a request for it.

Reg. 176/13, s. 14.</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (5) The following are the steps a person who proposes to carry out an activity described in subsection (2) must follow to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on chimney swift and its habitat:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1. If any part of the activity is to be carried out during the chimney swift active season, the person must take measures, such as capping the chimney, to prevent chimney swift from accessing the chimney that will be affected by the activity both before and during the chimney swift active season.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  2. If, despite following the measures described in paragraph 1, chimney swift begin to use the chimney during their active season to breed, nest, rear or roost, any part of the activity that would affect the chimney must be suspended until the end of the chimney swift active season.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  3. If, as a result of carrying out the activity, a chimney that provides habitat for chimney swift will be unavailable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting during the chimney swift active season, but will be available by the following chimney swift active season and will provide at least the same amount of suitable habitat for chimney swift at that time, the person must improve the conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting provided by the chimney by ensuring that the activity includes measures such as any of the following:</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i. increasing the height of the chimney,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. installing a sun collar on the opening of the chimney, or</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iii. cutting back vegetation encroaching on the chimney’s opening.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  4. The person must create new habitat for chimney swift in accordance with subsection (6) if, as a result of carrying out the activity, a chimney that provides habitat for chimney swift,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i. will be destroyed,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. will be altered so that it no longer provides suitable conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting or provides a smaller area for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, or </p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iii. will be unavailable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting for more than one chimney swift active season.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  5. The person must maintain habitat created under paragraph 4 for a period of three years after the habitat is created. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 308/16, s. 7 (2-5).</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (6) If a person is required to create new habitat for chimney swift under paragraph 4 of subsection (5), the habitat must be created as follows:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1. The habitat shall be created by either,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i. constructing one or more new structures, which may or may not be chimneys, that provide appropriate conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, or</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. modifying one or more existing structures which may or may not be chimneys, that do not currently provide habitat for chimney swift to provide appropriate conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  2. The habitat must include features to attract chimney swift to the structure or to enhance the suitability of the structure for chimney swift, such as installing a sun collar at the opening of the chimney or planting native shrubs, trees or flowers to attract insects.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  3. The structure that is constructed or modified must be located within two kilometres of the chimney that will be affected by the activity described in subsection (2) and must be capable of providing habitat for more chimney swifts than the chimney that was affected by the activity.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  4. If a single structure is constructed or modified, the structure must be of a greater height and have greater internal square footage available to chimney swift than the chimney affected by the activity described in subsection (2), but must not be greater than one and a half times the size of the chimney affected by the activity.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  5. If more than one structure is constructed or modified, one of the structures must be of at least the same height and have at least the same internal square footage available to chimney swift as the chimney affected by the activity described in subsection (2).</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  6. A structure must be constructed or modified so as to provide suitable conditions for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting, including the following:</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i. the structure must have a temperature range that is suitable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting during the chimney swift active season,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. the opening of the structure must be accessible for chimney swift to enter and exit,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iii. the interior surface of the structure must be composed of unpainted, rough-textured material such as brick or cinder block appropriate for clinging and nest adherence,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iv. the interior dimensions of the structure must be suitable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  v. the height of the structure must be suitable for chimney swift breeding, nesting, rearing or roosting having regard to the ground level, the roofline of associated structures and other structures or vegetation within reasonable proximity. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14; O. Reg. 308/16, s. 7 (6-9).</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (7) A person who proposes to carry out an activity described in subsection (2) and is required to create habitat for chimney swift under paragraph 4 of subsection (5) must do so within one of the following time frames:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1. If the activity will begin outside of the chimney swift active season, before the beginning of the next chimney swift active season.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  2. If the activity will begin during the chimney swift active season, before the beginning of that chimney swift active season. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14.</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (8) After a person has created habitat for chimney swift under paragraph 4 of subsection (5), the person shall monitor the use of the habitat by chimney swift during the chimney swift active season for a period of years determined under subsection (9) and shall record information collected during monitoring, including the following information:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1. An estimate of the number of chimney swift entering or exiting the structure.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  2. Evidence of chimney swift nesting in the structure. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14.</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (9) The number of years during which a person must monitor the effectiveness of habitat under subsection (8) shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1. If chimney swift are observed and recorded entering and exiting the structure during the first three years of monitoring, the person is not required to conduct further monitoring after the end of the three-year period.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  2. If chimney swift are not observed and recorded entering and exiting the structure during the first three years of monitoring, the person shall continue to monitor the habitat until five years have passed after the creation of the habitat under paragraph 4 of subsection (5). O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14.</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (10) A person who carries out an activity described in subsection (2) shall retain the chimney swift mitigation and restoration record created under subsection (4) for a period of five years after the activity is completed and shall update the record from time to time to include the following information:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  1.

A description of the places within the pit or quarry that are the habitat of, or used by, the species identified under paragraph 3. 5. Details on how the person will carry out the steps described in subsection (9) that the person must take to minimize the adverse effects of the operation of the pit or quarry on the species referred to in paragraph 3, including, i. the dates on which, and locations at which, each step will be carried out, and ii. the dates during the year when the species is likely to be carrying out a life process related to hibernation or reproduction, including rearing, and during which the person must avoid killing, harming or harassing members of the species. 6. A description of the steps the person plans to take to minimize the adverse effects of the operation of the pit or quarry on the species identified under paragraph 3, in addition to the steps described in subsection (9), including a description of, i. the training that will be provided to employees, agents and contractors that are likely to encounter members of the species while performing their duties, in order to satisfy the obligations under this section, ii. if the operation of the pit or quarry results in the damage or destruction of the habitat of the species, any measures to enhance or restore habitat for the species, iii. the steps the person will take to avoid or minimize killing, harming or harassing members of the species or damaging or destroying habitat, in addition to the steps described in paragraph 1 of subsection (9), and iv. the steps the person will take if a member of the species is encountered during the operation of the pit or quarry, in addition to the steps described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of subsection (9). 7. A description of the steps the person will take to monitor the effectiveness of the steps taken to minimize the adverse effects of the operation of the pit or quarry on the species identified under paragraph 3. O. Reg. 176/13, s. 14. (9) The steps that a person must take to minimize the adverse effects of the operation of a pit or quarry on a species identified in a notice of activity form submitted under paragraph 1 of subsection (5) are as follows: 1. The person must take steps to avoid or minimize killing, harming or harassing members of the species during a time of year when the species is likely to be carrying out a life process related to hibernation or reproduction, including rearing. 2. If the person encounters an animal that is a member of the species while operating the pit or quarry, the person must cease operations in the area of the encounter and provide the animal with a reasonable amount of time to leave the area before continuing the operation of the pit or quarry. 3. If, after providing an animal with a reasonable amount of time in accordance with paragraph 2 the animal does not leave the area, the person must take measures to relocate the animal to a nearby location that is suitable and safe for the animal. 4. If the person encounters a moss, lichen or vascular plant that is a member of the species while operating the pit or quarry and it is not necessary to kill or harm the member for the purpose of carrying out the activity, the person must, i. cease the activity in the area of the encounter, ii. install and maintain barriers or other structures to create a protective zone around the species, and iii. after establishing the protective zone referred to in subparagraph ii, continue the operation of the pit or quarry in a manner that does not impair the ability of the species to carry out its life processes, including reproduction. 5. If it is necessary to kill or harm a moss, lichen or vascular plant referred to in paragraph 4 for the purpose of operating the pit or quarry, the person must, provided it is feasible to do so, relocate the moss, lichen or vascular plant to a nearby location within the species’ habitat that is suitable and safe for the species. 6. The determination under paragraph 5 as to whether it is feasible to relocate a moss, lichen or vascular plant must be made by the person using the best available information with respect to the suitability of relocating that species, including information obtained from the Ministry. 7. The relocation of an animal in accordance with paragraph 3, or the relocation of a moss, lichen or vascular plant in accordance with paragraph 5, must be undertaken by, or in consultation with, a person who is knowledgeable about, or has training in, the handling of the species. 8. The person must take steps to exclude members of the species from an area of activity in the pit or quarry, such as installing fencing to prevent reptiles and amphibians from accessing active stockpiles of aggregates or areas of operation. 9. If the species uses nests or hibernacula to carry out its life processes, the person must, before and during the period of time when the species is likely to use the nests or hibernacula, install and maintain barriers or other structures to create a protective zone around the nests or hibernacula to limit the adverse effects that may be caused by the operation of the pit or quarry. 10. During a period of time when the species is likely to be using the nests or hibernacula to carry out life processes, the person must not carry out operations, i. within the protective zone installed under paragraph 9, or ii. in a manner that would impair the ability of the species to carry out its life processes within the protective zone. 11. The person must inform all employees, agents and contractors engaged in operating the pit or quarry that the species are present at the pit or quarry and of the steps required under paragraphs 1 to 10 and must install signs at the pit or quarry to that effect. 12.
