And it shall be lawful for the said ship, etc., in this voyage, to proceed and sail to and touch and stay at any ports or places whatsoever ..................... without prejudice to this insurance. The said ship, etc., goods and merchandises, etc., for so much as concerns the assured by agreement between the assured and assurers in this policy, are and shall be valued at ............................... (Sue and labour clause) (Waiver clause) Touching the adventures and perils which we, the assurers, are contented to bear and do take upon us in this voyage: they are of the seas, men-of-war, fire, enemies, pirates, rovers, thieves, jettisons, letters of mart and countermart, surprisals, takings at sea, arrests, restraints, and detainments of all kings, princes, and people, of what nation, condition, or quality soever, barratry of the master and mariners, and of all other perils, losses, and misfortunes, that have or shall come to the hurt, detriment, or damage of the said goods and merchandises, and ship, etc., or any part thereof. And in case of any loss or misfortune it shall be lawful to the assured, their factors, servants, and assigns, to sue, labour, and travel for, in and about the defence, safeguards, and recovery of the said goods and merchandises, and ship, etc., or any part thereof, without prejudice to this insurance; to the charges whereof we, the assurers, will contribute each one according to the rate and quantity of our sum herein assured. And it is especially declared and agreed that no acts of the insurer or insured in recovering, saving, or preserving the property insured shall be considered as a waiver, or acceptance of abandonment. And it is agreed by us, the insurers, that this writing or policy of assurance shall be of as much force and effect as the surest writing or policy of assurance heretofore made in Lombard Street, or in the Royal Exchange, or elsewhere in London. And so we, the assurers, are contented, and do hereby promise and bind ourselves, each one for our own part, our heirs, executors, and goods to the assured, their executors, administrators, and assigns, for the true performance of the premises, confessing ourselves paid the consideration due unto us for this assurance by the assured, at and after the rate of In witness whereof we, the assurers, have subscribed our names and sums assured in (Memorandum) N.B.—Corn, fish, salt, fruit, flour, and seed are warranted free from average, unless general, or the ship be stranded; sugar, tobacco, hemp, flax, hides and skins are warranted free from average, under five pounds per cent; and all other goods, also the ship and freight, are warranted free from average, under three pounds per cent, unless general, or the ship be stranded. Rules for Construction of Policy The following are the rules referred to by this Act for the construction of a policy in the above or other like form, where the context does not otherwise require: Lost or not lost 1. Where the subject-matter is insured “lost or not lost” and the loss has occurred before the contract is concluded, the risk attaches, unless at such time the assured was aware of the loss, and the insurer was not. From 2. Where the subject-matter is insured “from” a particular place, the risk does not attach until the ship starts on the voyage insured. At and from 3. (a) Where a ship is insured “at and from” a particular place, and it is at that place in good safety when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately. (Ship) (b) If the ship be not at that place when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as it arrives there in good safety, and, unless the policy otherwise provides, it is immaterial that it is covered by another policy for a specified time after arrival. (Freight) (c) Where chartered freight is insured “at and from” a particular place, and the ship is at that place in good safety when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately. If it be not there when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as it arrives there in good safety. Idem (d) Where freight, other than chartered freight, is payable without special conditions and is insured “at and from” a particular place, the risk attaches proportionately as the goods or merchandise are shipped; provided that if there be cargo in readiness which belongs to the ship-owner, or which some other person has contracted with the ship-owner to ship, the risk attaches as soon as the ship is ready to receive such cargo. From the loading thereof 4. Where goods or other movables are insured “from the loading thereof”, the risk does not attach until such goods or movables are actually on board, and the insurer is not liable for them while in transit from the shore to the ship. Safely landed 5. Where the risk on goods or other movables continues until they are “safely landed”, they must be landed in the customary manner and within a reasonable time after arrival at the port of discharge, and if they are not so landed the risk ceases. Touch and stay 6. In the absence of any further licence or usage, the liberty to touch and stay “at any port or place whatsoever” does not authorize the ship to depart from the course of its voyage from the port of departure to the port of destination. Perils of the sea 7. The term “perils of the sea” refers only to fortuitous accidents or casualties of the seas. It does not include the ordinary action of the winds and waves. Pirates 8. The term “pirates” includes passengers who mutiny and rioters who attack the ship from the shore. Thieves 9. The term “thieves” does not cover clandestine theft or a theft committed by any one of the ship’s company, whether crew or passengers. Restraint of princes 10. The term “arrests, etc., of kings, princes, and people” refers to political or executive acts, and does not include a loss caused by riot or by ordinary judicial process. Barratry 11. The term “barratry” includes every wrongful act wilfully committed by the master or crew to the prejudice of the owner, or, as the case may be, the charterer. All other perils 12. The term “all other perils” includes only perils similar in kind to the perils specifically mentioned in the policy. Average unless general 13. The term “average unless general” means a partial loss of the subject-matter insured other than a general average loss, and does not include “particular charges.” Stranded 14. Where the ship has stranded, the insurer is liable for the excepted losses, although the loss is not attributable to the stranding, provided that when the stranding takes place the risk has attached and, if the policy be on goods, that the damaged goods are on board. Ship 15. The term “ship” includes the hull, materials and outfit, stores and provisions for the officers and crew, and, in the case of vessels engaged in a special trade, the ordinary fittings requisite for the trade, and also, in the case of a steamship, the machinery, boilers, and coals, oils, and engine stores, if owned by the assured. Freight 16. The term “freight” includes the profit derivable by a ship-owner from the employment of the owner’s ship to carry the owner’s own goods or movables, as well as freight payable by a third party, but does not include passage-money. Goods 17. The term “goods” means goods in the nature of merchandise, and does not include personal effects or provisions and stores for use on board. In the absence of any usage to the contrary, deck cargo and living animals must be insured specifically, and not under the general denomination of goods. R.S.O. 1990, c.
