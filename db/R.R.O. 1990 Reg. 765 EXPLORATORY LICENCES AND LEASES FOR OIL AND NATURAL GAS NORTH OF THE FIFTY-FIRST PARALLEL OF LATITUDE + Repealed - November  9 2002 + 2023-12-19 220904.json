R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 765, s. 4 (8); O. Reg. 156/99, s. 1. (9) A deposit under subsection (7) is compliance with respect to expenditure requirements for the purpose of section 5. (10) Subject to subsection (11), where a licensee expends the minimum required for a year in which an amount has been deposited under subsection (7), the amount shall be refunded upon proof of the expenditure by means of the statement required by section 6. (11) Any sum expended, (a) after an amount has been deposited under subsection (7); (b) in respect of the lands described in a licence during the remaining term of the licence or of any renewal, shall be applied to the first year, second year and third year of the term of the licence and to the term of the first renewal, second renewal, third renewal, fourth renewal, fifth renewal and sixth renewal, in that order. (12) Where an amount has been deposited with the Minister with respect to the lands described in a licence and the licensee, (a) fails to deposit any further amount in the amount required by this section; (b) fails to expend the minimum sum required within the term, or a renewal term, of the licence; or (c) fails to obtain a renewal of the licence, that part of the amount deposited that equals the difference between the minimum required to be expended in the year or years for which the deposit was made and the amount expended for that year or those years is forfeit to the Crown in right of Ontario. (13) Where part of an amount that has been deposited is forfeited, the balance shall be refunded to the licensee within thirty days after the forfeiture. (14) Upon forfeiture of an amount deposited under subsection (7), the licence in respect of which the deposit was made is terminated. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 765, s. 4 (9-14).",
