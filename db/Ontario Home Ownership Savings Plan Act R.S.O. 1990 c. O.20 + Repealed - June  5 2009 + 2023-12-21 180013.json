The terms of the plan require the depositary to withhold and remit to the Minister any amount required under section 9 on any payment of assets of the plan to the planholder or to the legal personal representative of the planholder on the death of the planholder. 3. The terms of the plan provide that the depositary will accept repayment of assets into the plan from a solicitor to whom assets of the plan were paid. 4. The terms of the plan provide that the payment to the planholder is not capable in whole or in part of surrender, assignment or transfer except as permitted by an election under section 7. 5.
