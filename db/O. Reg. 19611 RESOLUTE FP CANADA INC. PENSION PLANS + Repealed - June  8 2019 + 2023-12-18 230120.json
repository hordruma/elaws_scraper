O. Reg. 464/16, s. 2. (7) The portion of the annual basic amortization contribution for a particular month reallocated to a particular participating Ontario pension plan is payable to the pension plan as a lump sum within 30 days after the end of the 12-month period described in subsection (1) as it would have been payable to the formerly-participating pension plan.  O. Reg. 196/11, s. 7 (7).

Calculate the amount of the payments made for unfunded pensions during the year using the formula, S × (T – U) in which, “S” is the amount paid from the pension plan during the year for pensions, “T” is 100 per cent, and “U” is the adjusted solvency ratio of the pension plan as of December 31 of the previous year. 2. Determine the sum of the payments of unfunded commuted value made during the year from the pension plan, which is an amount equal to the sum of the transfer deficiencies that are transferred during the year from the pension plan, i. excluding any transfer deficiencies paid from the pension plan during a year when the latest annual report indicates that the pension plan has a transfer ratio of one or more, and ii. excluding any transfer deficiencies funded through contributions made to the pension plan that are in addition to the contributions required under this Regulation. 3. Add the amounts calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.  O. Reg. 196/11, s. 9 (13); O. Reg. 105/14, s. 9 (2); O. Reg. 464/16, s. 4.",
