The pipes must be bedded in a continuous layer of stones that extends completely across the base of the waste fill zone and that has a minimum thickness of 0.3 metres on the base side slopes and a minimum thickness of 0.5 metres elsewhere.  The stones must have a D85 of not less than 37 millimetres, a D10 of not less than 19 millimetres, a uniformity coefficient (D60/D10) of less than 2.0, and, when measured by weight, not more than 1.0 per cent of the stones may pass the US #200 sieve. 2. A suitable geotextile or graded granular separator must be installed between the stone layer and the overlying waste and between the stone layer and any underlying soil or liner. 3. The perforated leachate collection pipes must be made of high density polyethylene (HDPE), with a minimum internal diameter of 150 millimetres and with perforations not less than 12 millimetres in diameter located along and around the pipes so that, i. the hydraulic capacity of the perforations can readily accommodate the expected quantity of leachate, ii. leachate that enters the pipes can readily flow within the pipes, iii. blockage by sedimentation is minimized, and iv. the structural integrity of the pipes is maintained. 4. The perforated leachate collection pipes must be bedded in the stones so that there is at least 250 millimetres of stones above the pipes and at least 50 millimetres of stones below the pipes. 5. The perforated leachate collection pipes must be placed across the base of the waste fill zone, excluding the base side slopes, and spaced so that the drainage path before leachate can potentially intercept a collection pipe is not more than 50 metres in length. 6. The leachate collection pipes must have adequate structural integrity to withstand impacts from waste placement and other site operations and to withstand the weight of the waste, cover material and any structures that may be located over them. 7. Leachate collection pipes must be inspected at least annually for the first five years after placement of waste overtop of each pipe and then as often as future inspections indicate to be necessary. 8. Leachate collection pipes must be cleaned whenever an inspection indicates that cleaning is necessary. 9. Leachate must be removed from the collection system in order to avoid obstructions to leachate flows within the system. 10. The base of the waste fill zone must be contoured to provide minimum surface grades of 0.5 per cent toward the leachate collection pipes. 11.
