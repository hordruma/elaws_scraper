An unconscionable consumer representation made in respect of a particular transaction and in determining whether or not a consumer representation is unconscionable there may be taken into account that the person making the representation or the person’s employer or principal knows or ought to know, i. that the consumer is not reasonably able to protect his or her interests because of physical infirmity, ignorance, illiteracy, inability to understand the language of an agreement or similar factors, ii. that the price grossly exceeds the price at which similar goods or services are readily available to like consumers, iii. that the consumer is unable to receive a substantial benefit from the subject-matter of the consumer representation, iv. that there is no reasonable probability of payment of the obligation in full by the consumer, v. that the proposed transaction is excessively one-sided in favour of someone other than the consumer, vi. that the terms or conditions of the proposed transaction are so adverse to the consumer as to be inequitable, vii. that he or she is making a misleading statement of opinion on which the consumer is likely to rely to his or her detriment, viii. that he or she is subjecting the consumer to undue pressure to enter into the transaction. 3.
