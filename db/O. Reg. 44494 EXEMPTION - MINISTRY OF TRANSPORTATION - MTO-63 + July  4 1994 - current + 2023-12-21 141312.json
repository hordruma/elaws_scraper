The amendments requested will not affect the nature of the undertaking and will reduce the negative impacts of the extraction process in that: i. The placing of the asphalt plant in an area depressed below ground level (Area 5) will reduce potential noise and visual impacts on nearby residences. ii. The changing of the sequence of extraction operations to leave a buffer of trees until the last extraction phase will reduce potential noise and visual impacts on nearby residences during the main time span of the operation. iii. The changing of the sequence of extraction operations to defer extraction activities in an area which contains an archaeological site will allow for a proper archaeological salvage of this area, should extraction be required. iv. The Highway 401 reconstruction/six-laning work requires traffic to be reduced to one lane during final paving operations. Allowing this work to occur at night when traffic volumes are lower will reduce traffic congestion, delays and inconvenience to the travelling public. v. Paving at night when the traffic volumes are lower will improve safety conditions for the travelling public and ministry and contractor’s construction staff. C. The amendments requested have been reviewed and endorsed by The Corporation of the Township of Puslinch. D.
