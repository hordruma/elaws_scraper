Recitals, statements and descriptions of facts, matters and parties contained in statutes, deeds, instruments or statutory declarations twenty years old at the date of the contract, unless and except in so far as they are proved to be inaccurate, are sufficient evidence of the truth of such facts, matters and descriptions. Memorials of discharged mortgages 2. A registered memorial of a discharged mortgage is sufficient evidence of the mortgage without the production of the mortgage, unless and except in so far as the memorial is proved to be inaccurate, and the vendor is not bound to produce the mortgage unless it is in the vendor’s possession or power. Memorials 20 years old, when and of what, evidence 3. A registered memorial twenty years old of any other instrument, if the memorial purports to be executed by the grantor, or in other cases if possession has been consistent with the registered title, is sufficient evidence without the production of the instrument to which the memorial relates, unless and except in so far as the memorial is proved to be inaccurate, and the vendor is not bound to produce the original instrument unless it is in the vendor’s possession or power, and the memorial shall be presumed to contain all the material contents of the instrument to which it relates. Inability to furnish covenant to produce and furnish documents of title 4. The inability of the vendor to furnish the purchaser with a legal covenant to produce and furnish copies of documents of title, is not an objection to the title if the purchaser will, on the completion of the contract, have an equitable right to the production of such documents.
