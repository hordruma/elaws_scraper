(2) For the purposes of this Regulation, the 2008-2009 day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils of a board is the day school average daily enrolment for the board determined under section 2 of the 2008-2009 A.D.E. regulation, counting only the elementary school pupils of the board. O. Reg. 85/08, s. 5 (2). (3) For the purposes of this Regulation, the 2008-2009 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of a board is the day school average daily enrolment for the board determined under section 2 of the 2008-2009 A.D.E. regulation, counting only secondary school pupils of the board who are under 21 years of age on December 31, 2008. O. Reg. 85/08, s. 5 (3). (4) For the purposes of this Regulation, the day school full-time equivalent enrolment for a board as of October 31, 2008 is determined using the formula, A + B + C/D in which, “A” is the number of full-time pupils of the board enrolled on October 31, 2008, excluding secondary school pupils who are at least 21 years of age on December 31, 2008, “B” is the amount equal to 0.5 times the number of half-time pupils of the board enrolled on October 31, 2008, “C” is the total of all amounts each of which is an amount determined for a part-time pupil of the board enrolled on October 31, 2008, other than a secondary school pupil who is at least 21 years of age on December 31, 2008, equal to the number of minutes for which the pupil is registered for classroom instruction in the cycle that includes October 31, 2008, in a course other than an independent study course, and “D” is the amount determined by multiplying the number of days in the cycle described in the definition of “C” by 300. O. Reg. 85/08, s. 5 (4). (5) If this Regulation requires that pupils be counted but does not provide that the count be on the basis of average daily enrolment or on the basis of full-time equivalent enrolment, each pupil, whether full-time, half-time or part-time, must be counted as one.

Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31, 2008 for which the teacher is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils of the board or to prepare for such instruction. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a count of hours is accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the total determined under subparagraph i by 5. 2. If a principal or vice-principal is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2008 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils of the board, the principal or vice-principal is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section and his or her full-time equivalency as a teacher is determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31, 2008 for which the principal or vice-principal is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils of the board. For the purposes of this subsection, a count of hours is accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the number determined under subparagraph i by 5. 3. An occasional teacher who is assigned to provide instruction to pupils of the board in a regular timetable in effect on October 31, 2008 is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section unless the teacher whom the occasional teacher replaces is included in determining the number of teachers employed by the board under subsection (3) and the board can reasonably expect the teacher to resume instructional duties with the board in the fiscal year. O. Reg. 85/08, s. 40 (4). (5) In this section, a cell of Table 9 is referred to by its qualification category co-ordinate followed by the number co-ordinate representing full years of teaching experience. For example, cell C-1 of Table 9 contains the number 0.6185 and cell A1/group 1-3 contains the number 0.7359. O. Reg. 85/08, s. 40 (5). (6) The following rules apply in determining the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher: 1. The number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2008-2009 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number. 2. If the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, the number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher is deemed to be 10. 3. The number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be 10. O. Reg. 85/08, s. 40 (6). (7) The following rules apply, as of October 31, 2008, to determine the qualification category of a teacher: 1. If a board uses an AEFO certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that AEFO certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 2. If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2008 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2008-2009 school year and October 31, 2008, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. 9.
