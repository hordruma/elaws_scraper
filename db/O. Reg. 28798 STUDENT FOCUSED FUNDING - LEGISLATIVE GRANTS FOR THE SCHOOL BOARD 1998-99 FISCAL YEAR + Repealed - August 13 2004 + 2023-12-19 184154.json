(3) For example, cell C-1 contains the number 0.6127 and cell A1/Group 1-3 contains the number 0.7416. (4) For the purposes of this section, the number of teachers employed by a board is the full-time equivalent number of persons employed by the board as of October 31, 1998 to teach. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the counting practices usually followed by the board for staffing purposes shall be followed, subject to the following rules: 1. A teacher who is not assigned to provide instruction to pupils in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 1998 shall not be counted for the purposes of this section. 2. The provision of library instruction or guidance to pupils shall be considered the provision of instruction to pupils for the purposes of paragraphs 1, 3 and 4. 3. Where a teacher is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 1998 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils and is also assigned, as of that date, under section 17 of Regulation 298 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990, to spend part of his or her time acting as a consultant, co-ordinator or supervisor, the full-time equivalency for the teacher shall be determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31, 1998 for which the teacher is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils or to prepare for such instruction. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a count of hours shall be accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the total determined under subparagraph i by five. 4. Where a principal or vice-principal is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 1998 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils, the principal or vice-principal shall be counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section and his or her full-time equivalency as a teacher shall be determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31, 1998 for which the principal or vice-principal is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils. For the purposes of this subsection, a count of hours shall be accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the number determined under subparagraph i by five. (6) Subject to subsections (7) and (8), when determining the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher employed by a board, the counting practices usually followed by the board when counting the amount of teaching experience shall be applied, as of October 31, 1998. (7) Where the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, as determined under subsection (6), the number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher shall be deemed to be 10. (8) The number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal shall be deemed to be 10. (9) The following rules shall be applied, as of October 31, 1998, to determine the qualification category of a teacher: 1. If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system shall be used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 2. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system shall be used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. Subject to paragraph 5, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the Education Relations Commission Data Form A for 1998 shall be used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 5, if a board does not use a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the Education Relations Commission Data Form A for 1998 shall be used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. In the circumstances described in paragraph 3 or 4, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system determined under paragraph 3 or 4. 6. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal shall be deemed to be A4/Group 4. 7. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 1998 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to October 31, 1998 or earlier, the changed qualification category shall be used for the purposes of this section. (10) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of section 11, the amount of the teacher compensation allocation for a district school board shall be determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 6, determine the number of teachers employed by the board who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and six months of teaching experience shall be counted for the purposes of cell D-0 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or Group 2 and three years and seven months of teaching experience shall be counted for the purposes of cell A2/Group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 6, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in Table 6. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum obtained under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board. 5. Subtract one from the number obtained under paragraph 4. 6. Multiply the result obtained under paragraph 5 by $2,685. 7. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by the 1998-99 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board. 8. Determine the special assistance amount for re-organization of secondary school staff, in accordance with subsection (11). 9. Determine the special assistance amount for a high credit per pupil average, if any, in accordance with subsection (12). 10. Add the amounts determined under paragraphs 7, 8 and 9. (11) For the purposes of paragraph 8 of subsection (10), the special assistance amount for re-organization of secondary school staff shall be determined by multiplying the 1998-99 day school average daily enrolment of secondary pupils of the board by $180. (12) For the purposes of paragraph 9 of subsection (10), the special assistance amount for a high credit per pupil average shall be determined as follows: 1. Determine the average number of credits per secondary school pupil of the board for the 1997-98 school year. 2. If the number determined under paragraph 1 is 7.5 or less but more than 7.2, deduct 7.2 from the number determined under paragraph 1. 3. If the number determined under paragraph 1 is more than 7.5, deduct 7.2 from 7.5. 4. Divide the number obtained under paragraph 2 or 3, as the case may be, by 7.2. 5. Multiply the number obtained under paragraph 4 by $2,748. 6. Multiply the amount obtained under paragraph 5 by the 1998-99 day school average daily enrolment of secondary pupils of the board. O.

(1) For the purposes of this section, (a) an expenditure by a board is a classroom expenditure if it is an expenditure categorized in the 1998-99 Uniform Code of Accounts as a classroom expenditure; and (b) an expenditure by a board is a non-classroom expenditure if it is an expenditure categorized in the 1998-99 Uniform Code of Accounts as a non-classroom expenditure. (2) The Minister shall prepare and publish the 1998-99 Uniform Code of Accounts, categorizing board expenditures as classroom and non-classroom expenditures, before the beginning of the 1998-99 fiscal year. (3) In meeting the requirements of subsection (2), the Minister shall follow the categorizations of classroom and non-classroom expenditures set out in the following three documents: 1. The Ministry publication entitled “Instructions for Updating the Costing Framework for 1996 and 1997”, dated May 30, 1997. 2. The Table entitled “Allocation of Grants to Expenditure Categories”, published by the Ministry and distributed to boards on March 25, 1998. 3. Appendix 1 to the Ministry publication entitled “Calculation of 1997 Net Expenditure”, distributed to boards in April, 1998. (4) Subsection (3) does not prevent the Minister from making minor adjustments in categorizations for the purpose of improving the accuracy with which classroom and non-classroom expenditures are distinguished. (5) Subject to subsection (10), a district school board shall ensure that its 1998-99 net classroom expenditure amount, calculated in accordance with subsection (6), is at least equal to its 1998-99 classroom expenditure allocation amount, calculated in accordance with subsection (8). (6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the 1998-99 net classroom expenditure amount for a board shall be determined as follows: 1. Determine the total amount of the board’s classroom expenditures in the 1998-99 fiscal year. 2. Subtract the amount determined for the board under subsection (7), on account of classroom-related revenue from sources other than legislative grants and school taxes. (7) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of subsection (6), the amount on account of classroom-related revenue from sources other than legislative grants and school taxes for the board shall be the total of the following amounts: 1. Take 68.49 per cent of the board’s revenues under the 1998-99 fees regulation. 2. Determine the total of the amounts spent on classroom expenditures from reserves of the board in the 1998-99 fiscal year. 3. This paragraph applies to grants to the board, other than grants made under this Regulation, and to donations to the board, where the board is legally required to spend the full amount of the grant or donation on expenditures that are classroom expenditures within the meaning of this section. Determine the amount received by the board in the 1998-99 fiscal year from grants and donations to which this paragraph applies. 4. This paragraph applies to grants to the board, other than grants made under this Regulation, and to donations to the board, where the board is not legally required to spend the full amount of the grant or donation on expenditures that are classroom expenditures within the meaning of this section. Determine the amount received by the board in the 1998-99 fiscal year from grants and donations to which this paragraph applies that are spent in the 1998-99 fiscal year on expenditures that are classroom expenditures within the meaning of this section. O. Reg. 287/98, s. 51 (1-7). (8) For the purposes of subsection (5), the 1998-99 classroom expenditure allocation amount for a board shall be determined as follows: 1.

Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for the elementary school part of foundation allocations to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 1. 3. Determine the amount calculated for the board under paragraph 4 of section 13, on account of the foundation allocation for secondary school pupils. 4. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for the secondary school part of foundation allocations to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 3. 5. Determine an amount for the board on account of French as a first or second language and Native as a second language, as follows: i. In the case of an English-language district school board, total the amounts determined for the board under paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 21. ii. In the case of a French-language district school board, total the amounts determined for the board under paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 25. 6. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for French as a first or second language and Native as a second language to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 5. 7.

In the case of an English-language district school board, take the amount determined for the board under paragraph 3 of section 21. ii. In the case of a French-language district school board, take the amount determined for the board under paragraph 3 of section 25. 8. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for ESL/ESD/ALF/PDF to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 7. 9. Determine an amount for the board on account of the elementary school part of teacher compensation allocations, by calculating what the amount calculated for the board under paragraph 7 of subsection 33 (10) would be if the calculation were done counting only teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils and counting only elementary pupils of the board. 10. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for elementary school teacher compensation to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 9. 11. Determine an amount for the board on account of the secondary school part of teacher compensation allocations, by subtracting, from the amount determined for the board under subsection 33 (10), the total of, i. the amount determined for the board under paragraph 9, and ii. the special assistance amount for re-organization of secondary school staff determined for the board under paragraph 8 of subsection 33 (10). 12. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for secondary school teacher compensation to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 11. 13. Determine the amount of each type of allocation determined for the board under sections 14, 29, 30, 31 and 34. 14. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for each type of allocation for which an amount is determined under paragraph 13 to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 13 for that type of allocation. 15. Multiply the enrolment number determined for the board under paragraph 1 of subsection 32 (1) by $2,257, to determine an adult day school amount for the board. 16. Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for adult day school to the amount determined for the board under paragraph 15. 16.1 Determine the retirement gratuity allocation for the board calculated under section 33.1. 16.2 Apply the percentage specified in Table 8 for retirement gratuities to the amount determined under paragraph 16.1. 17. Determine the amount, if any, calculated for the board under subsection 46 (2) as a phase-in funding deduction amount. Apply the percentage determined for the board under subsection (9) to that amount. 18. Determine the amount, if any, calculated for the board under subsection 47 (2) as a phase-in funding addition amount. Apply the percentage determined for the board under subsection (9) to that amount. 19. Total the amounts determined for the board under paragraphs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 16.2. 20. Where paragraph 17 applies to the board, deduct the amount obtained for the board under that paragraph from the amount obtained for the board under paragraph 19. 21. Where paragraph 18 applies to the board, add the amount obtained for the board under that paragraph from the amount obtained for the board under paragraph 19. O. Reg. 287/98, s. 51 (8); O. Reg. 537/98, s. 4. (9) For the purposes of paragraphs 17 and 18 of subsection (8), the board shall determine a percentage that reasonably corresponds to the way in which the board actually applies the phase-in funding deduction amount or phase-in funding addition amount, as the case may be, to classroom expenditures in the 1998-99 fiscal year. (10) A board shall be deemed to be in compliance with subsection (5) where its 1998-99 classroom expenditure allocation, calculated in accordance with subsection (8), exceeds its 1998-99 net classroom expenditure amount, calculated in accordance with subsection (6), if the board demonstrates, in a written report to the Minister, that the excess is accounted for by reason of expenditures other than non-classroom expenditures. (11) For example, (a) an amount paid on account of a part of a deficit from a previous year where the part of the deficit is reasonably attributable to classroom expenditures is not a non-classroom expenditure; and (b) an amount placed in a reserve fund for classroom expenditures is not a non-classroom expenditure. O. Reg. 287/98, s. 51 (9-11). (12) In making the determination under subsection (9), the board shall not apply the phase-in funding addition amount to expenditures that are not classroom expenditures and shall not apply the phase-in funding deduction amount to expenditures that are classroom expenditures if doing so would reduce the board’s 1998-99 net classroom expenditure allocation, calculated in accordance with subsection (8), to an amount lower than the amount for the board set out in the column entitled “1997 Net Expenditure” and the row entitled “9 Sub-total” in the Table entitled “Classroom — Non-classroom Summary Report”, which Table was released by the Ministry to school boards on March 25, 1998 and is available for public inspection at the offices of the Ministry of Education and Training, 900 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M7A 1L2.
