SPHERE OF APPLICATION Article 1. Scope of application 1 This Convention applies\nto the use of electronic communications in connection with the formation\nor performance of a contract between parties whose\nplaces of business\nare in different States. 2 The fact that the parties\nhave their places of business\nin different States is to be disregarded whenever\nthis fact does not appear\neither from the contract\nor from any dealings between\nthe parties or from information disclosed by the parties\nat any time before or at the conclusion of the contract. 3 Neither the nationality of the parties\nnor the civil or commercial character of the parties\nor of the contract is to be taken into consideration in determining the application of this Convention. Article 2. Exclusions 1 This Convention does not apply to electronic communications relating to any of the following: (a) Contracts concluded for personal, family\nor household purposes; (b) (i) Transactions on a regulated\nexchange; (ii) foreign\nexchange transactions; (iii) inter-bank payment systems, inter-bank payment agreements or clearance\nand settlement systems\nrelating to securities or other financial assets\nor instruments; (iv) the transfer\nof security rights\nin sale, loan or holding of or agreement\nto repurchase securities or other financial assets or instruments held with an intermediary. 2 This Convention does not apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes, consignment notes, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or any transferable document or instrument that entitles the bearer or beneficiary to claim the delivery of goods or the payment of a sum of money. Article 3. Party autonomy The parties may exclude the application of this Convention or derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions. CHAPTER II.   GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 4. Definitions For the purposes of this Convention: (a) “Communication” means any statement, declaration, demand, notice or request, including an offer and the acceptance of an offer, that the parties are required to make or choose to make in connection with the formation or performance of a contract; (b) “Electronic communication” means any communication that the parties make by means\nof data messages; (c) “Data message” means information generated, sent, received or stored\nby electronic, magnetic, optical or similar\nmeans, including, but not limited to, electronic data interchange, electronic mail, telegram,\ntelex or telecopy; (d) “Originator” of an electronic communication means a party by whom, or on whose behalf,\nthe electronic communication has been sent or generated prior to storage, if any, but it does not include\na party acting\nas an intermediary with respect to that electronic communication; (e) “Addressee” of an electronic communication means a party who is intended by the originator\nto receive the electronic communication, but does not include\na party acting as an intermediary with respect to that electronic\r\ncommunication; (f) “Information system” means a system for generating, sending, receiving, storing or otherwise processing data messages; (g) “Automated message system”\nmeans a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used to initiate an action or respond to data messages or performances in whole or in part, without review or intervention by a natural\nperson each time an action is initiated\nor a response is generated by the system; (h) “Place of business”\nmeans any place where a party maintains\na non-transitory establishment to pursue an economic activity\nother than the temporary provision of goods\nor services out of a specific location. Article 5. Interpretation 1 In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith in international trade. 2 Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law. Article 6. Location of the parties 1 For the purposes of this Convention, a party’s place of business is presumed to be the location indicated by that party, unless another party demonstrates that the party making the indication does not have a place of business at that location. 2 If a party has not indicated a place of business and has more than one place of business, then the place of business for the purposes of this Convention is that which has the closest relationship to the relevant contract, having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract. 3 If a natural person does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to the person’s habitual residence. 4 A location is not a place of business merely because that is: (a) where equipment and technology supporting an information system used by a\nparty in connection with the formation\nof a contract are located;\nor (b) where the information system may be accessed by other parties. 5 The sole fact that a party makes use of a domain name or electronic mail address connected to a specific country does not create a presumption that its place of business is located in that country. Article 7. Information requirements Nothing in this Convention affects\nthe application of any rule of law that\nmay require the parties to disclose their identities, places of business or other information, or relieves a party from the legal consequences of making\ninaccurate, incomplete or false statements in that regard. CHAPTER III.   USE OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS Article 8. Legal recognition of electronic communications 1 A communication or a contract shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that it is in the form of an electronic communication. 2 Nothing in this Convention requires a party to use or accept electronic communications, but a party’s agreement to do so may be inferred from the party’s conduct. Article 9. Form requirements 1 Nothing in this Convention requires a communication or a contract to be made or evidenced in any particular form. 2 Where the law requires that a communication or a contract should be in writing, or provides consequences for the absence of a writing, that requirement is met by an electronic communication if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 3 Where the law requires that a communication or a contract should be signed by a party, or provides consequences for the absence of a signature, that requirement is met in relation to an electronic communication if: (a) A method is used to identify the party and to indicate\nthat party’s intention in respect of the information contained in the electronic communication; and (b) The method used is either: (i) As reliable as appropriate for the purpose\nfor which the electronic communication was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement; or (ii) Proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described\nin subparagraph (a) above, by itself or together\nwith further evidence. 4 Where the law requires that a communication or a contract\nshould be made available\nor retained in its original\nform, or provides\nconsequences for the absence of an original, that requirement is met in relation to an electronic\ncommunication if: (a) There exists a reliable assurance\nas to the integrity of the information it contains from the time when it was first generated in its final form, as an electronic communication or otherwise; and (b) Where it is required that the information it contains be made available, that information is capable of being displayed to the person\nto whom it is to be made available. 5 For the purposes of paragraph 4 (a): (a) The criteria for assessing integrity\nshall be whether\nthe information has remained complete\nand unaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement and any change that arises in the normal\ncourse of communication, storage and display;\nand (b) The standard of reliability required\nshall be assessed\nin the light of the purpose\nfor which the information was generated and in the light of all\nthe relevant circumstances. Article 10. Time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications 1 The time of dispatch of an electronic communication is the time when it leaves an information system under the control of the originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator or, if the electronic communication has not left an information system under the control of the originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator, the time when the electronic communication is received. 2 The time of receipt of an electronic communication is the time when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at an electronic address designated by the addressee. The time of receipt of an electronic communication at another electronic address of the addressee is the time when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at that address and the addressee becomes aware that the electronic communication has been sent to that address. An electronic communication is presumed to be capable of being retrieved by the addressee when it reaches the addressee’s electronic address. 3 An electronic communication is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business, as determined in accordance with article 6. 4 Paragraph 2 of this article applies notwithstanding that the place where the information system supporting an electronic address is located may be different from the place where the electronic communication is deemed to be received under paragraph 3 of this article. Article 11. Invitations to make offers A proposal\nto conclude a contract\nmade through one or more electronic\r\ncommunications which is not addressed\nto one or more specific\nparties, but is generally\naccessible to parties making use of information systems, including proposals\nthat make use of interactive applications for the placement of orders\nthrough such information systems, is to be considered as an invitation to make offers,\nunless it clearly\nindicates the intention of the party making the proposal to be bound\nin case of acceptance. Article 12. Use of automated message systems for contract formation A contract formed by the interaction of an automated message system and a natural person, or by the interaction of automated message systems, shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that no natural person reviewed or intervened in each of the individual actions carried out by the automated message systems or the resulting contract. Article 13. Availability of contract terms Nothing in this Convention affects the application of any rule of law that may require a party that negotiates some or all of the terms of a contract through the exchange of electronic communications to make available to the other party those electronic communications which contain the contractual terms in a particular manner, or relieves a party from the legal consequences of its failure to do so. Article 14. Error in electronic communications 1 Where a natural\nperson makes an input error in an electronic communication exchanged with the automated message\nsystem of another\nparty and the automated message system does not provide\nthe person with an opportunity to correct the error, that person,\nor the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has the right\nto withdraw the portion of the electronic communication in which\nthe input error\nwas made if: (a) The person, or the party\non whose behalf\nthat person was acting, notifies the other party of the error as soon as possible\nafter having learned of the error and indicates that he or she made an error in the electronic communication; and (b) The person, or the party\non whose behalf\nthat person was acting, has not used or received\nany material benefit\nor value from the goods or services, if any, received from the other\nparty. 2 Nothing in this article affects the application of any rule of law that may govern the consequences of any error other than as provided for in paragraph 1. CHAPTER IV.   FINAL PROVISIONS Article 15. Depositary The Secretary-General of the United Nations is hereby designated as the depositary for this Convention. Article 16. Signature, ratification, acceptance or approval 1 This Convention is open for signature by all States at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 16 January 2006 to 16 January 2008. 2 This Convention is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by the signatory States. 3 This Convention is open for accession by all States that are not signatory States as from the date it is open for signature. 4 Instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval and accession are to be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Article 17. Participation by regional economic integration organizations 1 A regional economic\nintegration organization that is constituted by sovereign States and has competence over certain matters\ngoverned by this Convention may similarly sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to this Convention. The regional\neconomic integration organization shall in that case have the rights and obligations of a Contracting State, to the extent that that\norganization has competence\nover matters governed by this Convention. Where the number of Contracting States is relevant\nin this Convention, the regional economic integration organization shall not count as a Contracting State in addition to its member\nStates that are Contracting States. 2 The regional economic integration organization shall, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, make a declaration to the depositary specifying the matters governed by this Convention in respect of which competence has been transferred to that organization by its member States. The regional economic integration organization shall promptly notify the depositary of any changes to the distribution of competence, including new transfers of competence, specified in the declaration under this paragraph. 3 Any reference to a “Contracting State” or “Contracting States” in this Convention applies equally to a regional economic integration organization where the context so requires. 4 This Convention shall not prevail over any conflicting rules of any regional economic integration organization as applicable to parties whose respective places of business are located in States members of any such organization, as set out by declaration made in accordance with article 21. Article 18. Effect in domestic territorial units 1 If a Contracting State has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law are applicable in relation to the matters dealt with in this Convention, it may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, declare that this Convention is to extend to all its territorial units or only to one or more of them, and may amend its declaration by submitting another declaration at any time. 2 These declarations are to be notified to the depositary and are to state expressly the territorial units to which the Convention extends. 3 If, by virtue of a declaration under this article, this Convention extends to one or more but not all of the territorial units of a Contracting State, and if the place of business of a party is located in that State, this place of business, for the purposes of this Convention, is considered not to be in a Contracting State, unless it is in a territorial unit to which the Convention extends. 4 If a Contracting State makes no declaration under paragraph 1 of this article, the Convention is to extend to all territorial units of that State. Article 19. Declarations on the scope of application 1 Any Contracting State may declare, in accordance with article 21, that it will apply this Convention only: (a) When the States\nreferred to in article 1, paragraph 1, are Contracting States to this Convention; or (b) When the parties\nhave agreed that it applies. 2 Any Contracting State may exclude from the scope of application of this Convention the matters it specifies in a declaration made in accordance with article 21. Article 20. Communications exchanged under other international conventions 1 The provisions of this Convention apply to the use of electronic communications in connection with the formation\nor performance of a contract to which any of the following\ninternational conventions, to which a Contracting State to this Convention is or may become a Contracting State, apply: Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 10 June 1958); Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods (New York, 14 June 1974) and Protocol thereto (Vienna, 11 April 1980); United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna,\n11 April 1980); United Nations Convention on the Liability of Operators of Transport Terminals in International Trade (Vienna,\n19 April 1991); United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit (New York, 11 December 1995); United Nations Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade (New York,\n12 December 2001). 2 The provisions of this Convention apply further to electronic communications in connection with the formation or performance of a contract to which another international convention, treaty or agreement not specifically referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, and to which a Contracting State to this Convention is or may become a Contracting State, applies, unless the State has declared, in accordance with article 21, that it will not be bound by this paragraph. 3 A State that makes a declaration pursuant to paragraph 2 of this article may also declare that it will nevertheless apply the provisions of this Convention to the use of electronic communications in connection with the formation or performance of any contract to which a specified international convention, treaty or agreement applies to which the State is or may become a Contracting State. 4 Any State may declare that it will not apply the provisions of this Convention to the use of electronic communications in connection with the formation or performance of a contract to which any international convention, treaty or agreement specified in that State’s declaration, to which the State is or may become a Contracting State, applies, including any of the conventions referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, even if such State has not excluded the application of paragraph 2 of this article by a declaration made in accordance with article 21. Article 21. Procedure and effects of declarations 1 Declarations under article 17, paragraph 4, article 19, paragraphs 1 and 2, and article 20, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, may be made at any time.

However, a declaration of which the depositary receives formal notification after such entry into force takes effect on the first day of the month following the expiration of six months after the date of its receipt by the depositary. 4 Any State that makes a declaration under this Convention may modify or withdraw it at any time by a formal notification in writing addressed to the depositary. The modification or withdrawal is to take effect on the first day of the month following the expiration of six months after the date of the receipt of the notification by the depositary. Article 22.

Entry into force 1 This Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of six months after the date of deposit of the third instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. 2 When a State ratifies, accepts, approves or accedes to this Convention after the deposit of the third instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, this Convention enters into force in respect of that State on the first day of the month following the expiration of six months after the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. Article 24. Time of application This Convention and any declaration apply only to electronic communications that are made after the date when the Convention or the declaration enters into force or takes effect in respect of each Contracting State.
