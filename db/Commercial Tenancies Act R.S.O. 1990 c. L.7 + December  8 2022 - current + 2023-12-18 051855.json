Lease until breach (3) For the purposes of this section, a lease limited to continue only as long as the lessee abstains from committing a breach of covenant is and takes effect as a lease to continue for any longer term for which it could subsist, but determinable by a proviso for re-entry on such a breach.  R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, s. 20 (3).
