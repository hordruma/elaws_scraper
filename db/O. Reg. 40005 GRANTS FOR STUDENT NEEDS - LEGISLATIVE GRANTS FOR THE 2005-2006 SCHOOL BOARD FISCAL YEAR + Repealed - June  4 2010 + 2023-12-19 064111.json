In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8.

O. Reg. 400/05, s. 38 (5); O. Reg. 45/07, s. 3 (2).

O. Reg. 400/05, s. 38 (6). (7) The amount under this subsection in respect of a board is determined as follows: 1. If the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (6) does not exceed 0.0025, the amount determined under this subsection in respect of the board is calculated using the formula, 0.5 × C in which, “C” is the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (6). 2. If the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (6) is greater than 0.0025 but does not exceed 0.015, the amount determined under this subsection in respect of the board is calculated using the formula, (C – 0.0025) + 0.00125 in which, “C” is the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (6). 3. If the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (6) is greater than 0.015, the amount determined under this subsection in respect of the board is calculated using the formula, 1.5 × (C – 0.015) + 0.01375 in which, “C” is the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (6).
