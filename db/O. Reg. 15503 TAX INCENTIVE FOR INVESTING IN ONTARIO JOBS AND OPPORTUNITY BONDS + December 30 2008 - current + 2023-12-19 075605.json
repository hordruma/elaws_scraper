If the corporation is exempt from tax for the year under Part III of the Taxation Act, 2007, the refund is nil. 2. If the corporation would have had no taxable income for the year for the purposes of the Taxation Act, 2007 if the corporation had been entitled to deduct its Ontario Jobs and Opportunity Bond income when calculating its income for the year for the purposes of Division B of Part III of that Act, the refund is calculated using the formula, C + [(D – E) × F] in which, “C” is the amount of tax that would be payable by the corporation under the Taxation Act, 2007 for the year if that amount were determined under only subdivision a of Division B of Part III of that Act, “D” is the amount, if any, of the corporation’s Ontario Jobs and Opportunity Bond income for the year as determined under subsection (2), “E” is the corporation’s taxable income for the year as determined under the Taxation Act, 2007, and “F” is the corporation’s adjusted basic rate for the year as determined under subsection 46 (1) of the Taxation Act, 2007. 3. If neither paragraph 1 nor 2 applies to the corporation for the taxation year, the refund is calculated using the formula, C – G in which, “C” has the same meaning as in paragraph 2, and “G” is the amount of tax that would be payable by the corporation under the\r\nTaxation Act, 2007 for the year if that amount were, (a) determined under only subdivision a of Division B of Part III of that Act, and (b) determined as if the corporation were entitled to deduct in computing its income an amount equal to its Ontario Jobs and Opportunity Bond income, if any, for the year. O. Reg. 456/08, s. 3. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a corporation’s Ontario Jobs and Opportunity Bond income for a taxation year is the amount calculated using the formula, H – I in which, “H” is the sum of all amounts, each of which is interest in respect of an Ontario Jobs and Opportunity Bond that is included in computing the corporation’s income for the taxation year under section 12 or subsection 20 (14) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), and “I” is the sum of all amounts, each of which is a deduction that is claimed by the corporation for the taxation year under subsection 20 (14) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of interest on an Ontario Jobs and Opportunity Bond that is included in computing the corporation’s income for the year.

The last day of the second month ending after the end of the taxation year. 2. The day on which an application for the refund, made in accordance with subsection (4), is received by the Minister.  O. Reg. 456/08, s. 3. (6) No interest is payable in respect of a refund referred to in clause 1 (b) for a taxation year if the corporation’s tax under Division B of Part III of the Taxation Act, 2007 for the year is nil.  O. Reg. 456/08, s. 3. (7) If the Minister receives an application for a refund made in accordance with subsection (4), the Minister shall, (a) send a notice of entitlement to the corporation setting out, (i) whether the corporation is entitled to a refund and the amount of the refund, if any, to which the corporation is entitled, (ii) the basis on which the Minister determined that the corporation is or is not entitled to a refund, and (iii) information about the corporation’s right to object to the notice of entitlement; and (b) if the corporation is entitled to a refund, pay the refund and any interest payable under subsection (5) to the corporation, except that if the corporation is liable or is about to become liable for an amount to the Crown in right of Ontario under any Act, the Minister may apply all or part of the refund and interest to that liability and notify the corporation of that action.

O. Reg. 456/08, s. 3. (9) All amounts repayable under subsection (8) shall bear interest as if they were tax payable under the Act and may be assessed and collected as if they were tax payable under the Act.  O.

(10) Part V of the Act applies with necessary modifications in respect of a refund and notice of entitlement under this section as if a notice of entitlement were a notice of assessment.  O.
