(4) If any part of the burial pit is less than 15 metres from a field drainage tile, dead farm animals buried in the pit must be placed so that the highest point of the uppermost dead animal in the pit is lower than the lowest point of the nearest field drainage tile.  O. Reg. 106/09, s. 10 (4). (5) A burial pit is open on the day an operator first buries a dead farm animal in the pit, and the operator must monitor the open pit and ensure that the following rules are complied with until the pit is closed: 1. All dead farm animals placed in the pit must at all times be covered with at least 0.6 metres of soil. 2.

If any part of the soil covering a closed burial pit sinks below the level of the ground at the perimeter of the pit, the operator must rebuild the mound to the level of the ground at the perimeter of the pit. 2.
