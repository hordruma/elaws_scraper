If the authorizing certificate granted to the individual by the out-of-province regulatory authority is subject to a term, condition or limitation, i. imposing an equivalent term, condition or limitation on the authorizing certificate to be granted by the Ontario regulatory authority to the individual, or ii. refusing to certify the individual, if the Ontario regulatory authority does not impose an equivalent term, condition or limitation on the authorizing certificate that it grants for the occupation.  2009, c. 24, s. 9 (7).

Costs (9) The Ontario regulatory authority shall ensure that any requirements it imposes on the individual, and any measures it carries out with respect to the individual, in connection with the certification of the individual in the regulated occupation do not result in the imposition on the individual of fees or other costs that are more onerous than those the Ontario regulatory authority would impose if the individual were not certified by an out-of-province regulatory authority, unless the difference in such fees or other costs reflects the actual cost differential to the Ontario regulatory authority.  2009, c. 24, s. 9 (9). Expeditious certification (10) The Ontario regulatory authority shall ensure that its imposition of certification requirements on the individual under subsections (3), (4) and (5) and its imposition of terms, conditions or limitations on the individual’s authorizing certificate under subsection (7) do not prevent the expeditious certification of the individual.  2009, c. 24, s. 9 (10).
