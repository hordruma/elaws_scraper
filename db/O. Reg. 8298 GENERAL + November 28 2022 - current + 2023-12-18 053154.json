A municipality may agree to recognize some credits in accordance with an application and refuse to recognize other credits and, if the municipality does so, paragraph 8 applies but only with respect to the credits that the municipality agrees to recognize.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  10. If the municipality refuses to recognize a credit in accordance with an application, the applicant may appeal the municipality’s decision to the Ontario Municipal Board by filing with the clerk of the municipality, within 30 days after the applicant receives the notice of the municipality’s refusal, a notice of appeal.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  11. If a notice of appeal under paragraph 10 is filed with the clerk of the municipality, the clerk shall,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i. compile a record that includes a copy of the application and the notice of the municipality’s refusal,</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  ii. forward a copy of the notice of appeal and the record to the secretary of the Ontario Municipal Board within 30 days after the notice is received, and</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  iii. provide any other information and material that the Board may require in respect of the appeal.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  12. The Ontario Municipal Board shall hold a hearing to deal with the notice of appeal.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  13. The parties to the appeal are the appellant and the municipality.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  14. The Ontario Municipal Board shall give notice of the hearing to the parties.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  15. After the hearing, the Ontario Municipal Board shall determine whether the appellant is entitled to the recognition of a credit and, if so, shall determine the amount of the credit to be recognized and the services to which it relates. </p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  16. Despite paragraph 12, the Ontario Municipal Board may, where it is of the opinion that the complaint set out in the notice of appeal is insufficient, dismiss the appeal without holding a full hearing after notifying the appellant and giving the appellant an opportunity to make representations as to the merits of the appeal.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  17. An applicant and the municipality may, at any time before the commencement of the hearing before the Ontario Municipal Board, agree that the applicant is entitled to the recognition of a credit and may agree to the amount of the credit to be recognized and the service to which it relates. </p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">  18. If the applicant and the municipality enter into an agreement under paragraph 17, the applicant shall withdraw the appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board and the appeal shall be deemed to be terminated.  O. Reg. 82/98, s. 17; O. Reg. 439/99, s. 1; O.
