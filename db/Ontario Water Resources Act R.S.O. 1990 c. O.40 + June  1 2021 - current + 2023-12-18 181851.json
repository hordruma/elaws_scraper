The new or increased transfer amount is returned, either naturally or after use, to the same Great Lakes watershed from which it was taken, except for an amount prescribed by the regulations that may be lost through consumptive use. 2.  The efficient use and conservation of existing water supplies cannot reasonably avoid, i.  the transfer, in the case of a new transfer, or ii.  the transfer of the additional amount, in the case of an increased transfer. 3.  The new or increased transfer amount is reasonable, given the purposes for which, i.  the transfer is done, in the case of a new transfer, or ii.  the transfer of the additional amount is done, in the case of an increased transfer. 4.  The transfer, in the case of a new transfer, or the transfer of the additional amount, in the case of an increased transfer, is implemented so as to ensure that it does not result in any significant individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the quantity or quality of the waters, or the water-dependent natural resources, of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin, considering the potential cumulative impacts of any precedent-setting consequences associated with the transfer or the transfer of the additional amount, as the case may be. 5.  The transfer, in the case of a new transfer, or the transfer of the additional amount, in the case of an increased transfer, is implemented so as to incorporate feasible, environmentally sound and cost effective water conservation measures to minimize the taking of water and losses of water through consumptive use. 6.  The transfer is implemented so as to ensure that it complies with, i.  the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, ii.  the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act (Canada), and iii.  any other treaty, agreement or law that is prescribed by the regulations. 7.  The transfer, in the case of a new transfer, or the transfer of the additional amount, in the case of an increased transfer, is implemented so as to ensure that it complies with any other criteria that are prescribed by the regulations for the purpose of implementing Article 209 (Amendments to the Standard and Exception Standard and Periodic Assessment of Cumulative Impacts) of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement of 2005, including criteria relating to climate change or other significant threats to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin.  2007, c. 12, s. 1 (12).

Exceptions (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to, (a)  a contravention of subsection 30 (1), if, (i)  neither this Act nor the Environmental Protection Act requires the regulated person to notify the Ministry of the discharge to which the contravention relates, or (ii)  the discharge to which the contravention relates was authorized under this Act or the Environmental Protection Act; or (b)  a contravention of section 98.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Contents of order (3) The order shall be served on the person who is required to pay the penalty and shall, (a)  contain a description of the contravention to which the order relates, including, where appropriate, the date and location of the contravention; (b)  in the case of a contravention of subsection 30 (1), contain a description of how the contravention may impair the quality of the water of any waters; (c)  specify the amount of the penalty; (d)  give particulars respecting the time for paying the penalty and the manner of payment; and (e)  provide information to the person as to the personâs rights under section 100.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28); 2007, c. 10, Sched.

Same (7) For greater certainty, nothing in subsection (6) affects the prosecution of an offence.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28).

No admission (12) If a person pays a penalty imposed under subsection (1) in respect of a contravention or enters into an agreement under subsection (9) in respect of a contravention, the payment or entering into of the agreement is not, for the purposes of any prosecution in respect of the contravention, an admission that the person committed the contravention.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Failure to pay when required (13) If a person who is required to pay an environmental penalty fails to comply with the requirement, (a)  the order or decision that requires the payment may be filed with a local registrar of the Superior Court of Justice and may be enforced as if it were an order of the court; (b)  the Director may by order suspend any licence, permit or approval that has been issued to the person under this Act until the environmental penalty is paid; and (c)  the Director may refuse to issue any licence, permit or approval to the person under this Act until the environmental penalty is paid.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Same (14) Section 129 of the Courts of Justice Act applies in respect of an order or decision filed with the Superior Court of Justice under subsection (13) and, for that purpose, the date on which the order or decision is filed under subsection (13) shall be deemed to be the date of the order that is referred to in section 129 of the Courts of Justice Act.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28).

The determination of the amount of the penalty must take into account factors prescribed by the regulations that relate to the seriousness of the contravention in respect of which the penalty is imposed. 3.  If the Director is of the opinion that, as a result of the contravention in respect of which the penalty is imposed, a monetary benefit prescribed by the regulations was acquired by the person who is required to pay the penalty, the amount of the benefit must be considered in determining the amount of the penalty.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Environmental management systems (18) The regulations made under clause (15) (d) must provide for a reduction in the amount of an environmental penalty if, at the time the contravention to which the penalty relates occurred, the person who is required to pay the penalty had in place an environmental management system specified by the regulations.  2005, c. 12, s. 2 (28). Annual report (19) The Minister shall, not later than March 31 in each year, publish a report that sets out the following information for each contravention in respect of which an order was made under this section during the previous year: 1.

Contents of order (9) An order mentioned in subsection (2) shall be served on the person who is required to pay the administrative penalty and shall, (a)  contain a description of the contravention to which the order relates, including, if appropriate, the date of the contravention; (b)  specify the amount of the penalty; (c)  give particulars respecting the time for paying the penalty and the manner of payment; and (d)  provide information to the person as to the personâs right to require, (i)  a hearing under section 100, if the order is issued by the Director, or (ii)  a review under section 106.3, if the order is issued by a provincial officer. 2019, c. 14, Sched. 8, s. 38. Absolute liability (10) A requirement that a person pay an administrative penalty applies even if, (a)  the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention; or (b)  at the time of the contravention, the person had an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts that, if true, would have rendered the contravention innocent. 2019, c. 14, Sched. 8, s. 38.

No admission (13) If a person pays an administrative penalty in respect of a contravention, the payment is not, for the purposes of any prosecution in respect of the contravention, an admission that the person committed the contravention. 2019, c. 14, Sched. 8, s. 38.
