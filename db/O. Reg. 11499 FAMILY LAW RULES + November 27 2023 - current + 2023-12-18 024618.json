Offers involving special party or child party (12) An offer may be made, withdrawn or accepted by a special party or a child party, but neither a partyâs acceptance of a special partyâs or child partyâs offer nor the special partyâs or child partyâs acceptance of another partyâs offer are binding on the special party or child party until the court approves. O. Reg. 250/19, s. 6. Failure to carry out terms of accepted offer (13) If a party to an accepted offer does not carry out the terms of the offer, the other party may, (a)  make a motion to turn the parts of the offer within the courtâs jurisdiction into an order; or (b)  continue the case as if the offer had never been accepted.  O. Reg. 114/99, r. 18 (13). Costs consequences of failure to accept offer (14) A party who makes an offer is, unless the court orders otherwise, entitled to costs to the date the offer was served and full recovery of costs from that date, if the following conditions are met: 1.  If the offer relates to a motion, it is made at least one day before the motion date. 2.  If the offer relates to a trial or the hearing of a step other than a motion, it is made at least seven days before the trial or hearing date. 3.  The offer does not expire and is not withdrawn before the hearing starts. 4.  The offer is not accepted. 5.  The party who made the offer obtains an order that is as favourable as or more favourable than the offer.  O. Reg. 114/99, r. 18 (14). Costs consequences â burden of proof (15) The burden of proving that the order is as favourable as or more favourable than the offer to settle is on the party who claims the benefit of subrule (14).  O. Reg. 114/99, r. 18 (15). Costs â discretion of court (16) When the court exercises its discretion over costs, it may take into account any written offer to settle, the date it was made and its terms, even if subrule (14) does not apply.
