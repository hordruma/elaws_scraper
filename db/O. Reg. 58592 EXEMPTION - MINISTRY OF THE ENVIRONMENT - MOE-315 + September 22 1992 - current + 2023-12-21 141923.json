This undertaking involves the management of wastes, including, (a) cleaning up the site and immediately surrounding area and bedrock; (b) destroying, by approved mobile incineration facilities, PCB waste stored at the area; (c) decontaminating PCB contaminated soils and possibly bedrock, and subsequently redepositing them; (d) storing, temporarily, in existing or new structures, any waste that cannot be destroyed or decontaminated on the property until it can be removed to other certified waste disposal sites when they become available; and (e) offering first right of acquisition of the property to The Corporation of the Township of West Lincoln once the site has been restored to a clean condition so that it may be used for the originally intended use. 3. The principal activities associated with the undertaking include the following, (a) acquisition, through ownership by the Province of the property formerly used by Chemical Waste Management Limited at the Smithville Site and acquisition of the right to use any necessary adjacent property; (b) consolidation of the wastes, including: contaminated soils, contaminated equipment and materials associated with ongoing cleanup activities at the site; (c) destruction of PCB wastes by means of approved facilities; (d) construction and preparation of a wastewater treatment facility for treatment of contaminated water, as an initial short-term remedial activity; (e) trial excavation of the bedrock and selection and implementation of the appropriate technology for remediation of the contaminated groundwater and bedrock; (f) removal from the site of any wastes that cannot be destroyed or decontaminated; and (g) continuation of an appropriate groundwater monitoring program. 4. This order does not apply to the storage of PCB waste on the site after March 31, 1993 except for such wastes contained in rock cores obtained during investigations and such wastes as may be produced by the existing water treatment facilities which are treating contaminated groundwater collected by the aquifer purge well system or by such other water treatment facilities that may replace the existing facilities from time to time for the same purpose. All PCB wastes stored on the site which are not being destroyed under this exemption order nor retained for research purposes that can be legally stored or disposed of at any other location shall be removed from the site as soon as possible. 5. The Liaison Committee referred to in reason A and the Municipal Council shall be consulted and kept advised with respect to the details of the undertaking as they are developed and progress is made in their implementation. 6. The undertaking shall be monitored by the Ministry of the Environment and/or its agents, to ensure that the waste management activities do not result in injury or damage to persons and property. 7. A written report shall be prepared on the undertaking and updated annually over the period in which the contaminated wastes are managed. The report shall describe the activities and the results of the ongoing monitoring program and how the terms and conditions of this order are being complied with. The report shall be submitted by the Regional Director, West Central Region of the Ministry of the Environment to the Director of Environmental Assessment Branch for filing in the public record.
