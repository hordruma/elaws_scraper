O. Reg. 200/21, s. 1 (1); O. Reg. 294/22, s. 1 (1). (2) A reconciliation report under subsection (1) shall be submitted in the form and manner, with the content and by the date determined in accordance with, (a)  the accountability agreement between the Minister and the Agency required under section 19 of the Act; and (b)  the service accountability agreement between the licensee of the long-term care home and the Agency required under section 22 of the Act. O. Reg. 200/21, s. 1 (2). (3) Before submitting the reconciliation report required under clause (1) (a), the licensee shall ensure that the report is audited by a person licensed under the Public Accounting Act, 2004 or, in the case of a municipal home or a joint home approved under Part IX of the Fixing Long-Term Care Act, 2021, by the municipal auditor who audits the books of account and ledgers of the home.

O. Reg. 200/21, s. 1 (4).
