The individual is at least 18 years old. 2.  The individual is a resident of Canada. 3.  The individual has a mailing address in Ontario that is not a post office box and that is suitable to permit service by registered mail. 4.  The individual is authorized by a brokerage to deal or trade in mortgages on its behalf. 5.  The individual has successfully completed the approved education programs for a Mortgage Agent Level 1 licence and a Mortgage Agent Level 2 licence. 6.  The individual has been licensed as a Mortgage Agent Level 2 for at least 24 of the 36 months immediately before the individual applies for the licence. 7.  The individual has successfully completed an approved education program for mortgage brokers within three years before he or she applies for the licence. 8.  The individual has passed the approved qualifying exam for mortgage brokers within three years before he or she applies for the licence.  O. Reg. 409/07, s. 2 (1); O. Reg. 391/22, s. 2 (1). (2) An individual is deemed to have satisfied one or more of the prescribed education and experience requirements for a broker’s licence if the Chief Executive Officer is satisfied that the individual has a combination of education and experience that is equivalent to the applicable requirement.  O. Reg. 409/07, s. 2 (2); O. Reg. 173/19, s. 1. (3) The following rules apply with respect to the annual licensing cycles that begin on April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2024: 1.  Despite paragraph 5 of subsection (1), an individual who was licensed as a mortgage broker on March 31, 2023 may be issued a mortgage broker’s licence for the annual licensing cycle that begins on April 1, 2023 even if the individual has not successfully completed the approved education programs described in that paragraph. 2.  If an individual described in paragraph 1 does not successfully complete the approved education programs described in paragraph 5 of subsection (1) on or before March 31, 2024, the individual is not eligible to be issued a mortgage broker’s licence for the annual licensing cycle that begins on April 1, 2024 but is eligible to be issued a Mortgage Agent Level 1 licence for that annual licensing cycle if the requirements in section 5.0.1 are satisfied. 3.

Instead, the individual must have been licensed as a mortgage agent under this Regulation as it read on March 31, 2023 or as a Mortgage Agent Level 2 for at least 24 of the 36 months immediately before the individual applies for the licence in the applicable annual licensing cycle. 4.
