O. Reg. 333/08, s. 50 (10). (11) If no agreement is reached under subsection (8) within the time period specified in that subsection, (a)  the person who gave the notice of cancellation of the contract shall return the motor vehicle to the registered motor vehicle dealer at a time that is on or after 21 days after giving the notice and no later than 30 days after giving the notice; and (b)  the registered motor vehicle dealer shall immediately refund to the person who gave the notice of cancellation of the contract any payment described in clause (10) (b).

O. Reg. 333/08, s. 79 (1). (2) Subsection 37 (3) of the Act does not apply to a notice given under clause 79 (1) (e) of this Regulation.  O. Reg. 333/08, s. 79 (2). (3) The requirements for a claim mentioned in clause (1) (b) are the following: 1.  The claim arose from an act or omission of the registered motor vehicle dealer that was the subject of a proposal under clause 9 (1) (a) or (b) of the Act to suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the registration of the dealer and, i.  the dealer did not request a hearing by the Tribunal, or ii.  the dealer requested a hearing by the Tribunal and the Tribunal ordered the registrar to suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the registration of the dealer. 2.  The claim arose from a trade in connection with which the registered motor vehicle dealer has been convicted of an offence. 3.  The trade from which the claim arose was a purchase or lease of a motor vehicle from the registered motor vehicle dealer. A law enforcement authority has seized the vehicle and indicated that it will not be returned to the purchaser or the lessee. 4.  The trade from which the claim arose was a purchase or lease of a motor vehicle from the registered motor vehicle dealer. A creditor, other than a creditor of the customer, has legally seized the vehicle and indicated that it will not be returned to the purchaser or the lessee. 5.  The trade from which the claim arose was a purchase or lease of a motor vehicle from the registered motor vehicle dealer. The claim does not exceed the total sale price of the vehicle at the time of the purchase, if the claim arose from a purchase of the vehicle, or the lease value of the vehicle included in the information mentioned in subparagraph 1 i of subsection 41 (1) at the time of the lease, if the claim arose from a lease of the vehicle. The claim is for a deficiency that the dealer has refused to remedy. The deficiency is something that, i.  the vehicle does not have and the customer had indicated was material to the trade for the vehicle to have, or ii.  the vehicle has and the customer had indicated was material to the trade for the vehicle not to have. 6.

The claim relates to an extended warranty that was sold by the registered motor vehicle dealer or facilitated through the dealer.

The claim relates to a service plan that was sold by the registered motor vehicle dealer or facilitated through the dealer.

The claim is for a refund owed to a customer under clause 50 (10) (b) or (11) (b) if the customer is entitled to a refund under the applicable clause. 10.  The amount of the claim is the subject of a judgment or an order made by a court for the payment of compensation or the making of restitution by the registered motor vehicle dealer to the customer. The judgment or order has become final by reason of the expiration of the time for appeal or of having been confirmed by the highest court to which an appeal may be taken. 11.

O. Reg. 333/08, s. 79 (3); O. Reg. 221/09, s. 19 (1). (4) Despite subsection (1), a customer is not entitled to compensation from the Fund if, (a)  the customer is related, by blood or adoption, to the registered motor vehicle dealer against whom a claim is made or to a director or officer of the dealer; (b)  the customer is a spouse of the registered motor vehicle dealer against whom a claim is made or a spouse of a director or officer of the dealer; (c)  the customer is associated, as described in subsection 1 (2) of the Act, with the registered motor vehicle dealer against whom a claim is made; (d)  the customer was complicit in illegal conduct relating to the trade; (e)  the customer misrepresents the nature of the claim or provides false or misleading evidence in support of the claim; or (f)  the customer made a previous claim for compensation from the Fund based on the same facts or substantially the same facts.  O. Reg. 333/08, s. 79 (4). (5) If the Board determines that a customer of a registered motor vehicle dealer is entitled to compensation from the Fund in respect of a claim described in subparagraph 7 ii of subsection (3), the Board may direct the Trustee, in addition to paying the compensation, to pay the customer the amount of the premiums that the customer is required to make under the extended warranty that is unearned at the time that the customer makes the claim.  O. Reg. 221/09, s. 19 (2). (6) If the Board directs the Trustee to pay the additional payment described in subsection (5) from the Fund, the customer is not entitled to compensation from the Fund for any further claims described in subparagraph 7 ii of subsection (3).
