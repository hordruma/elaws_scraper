The holder shall determine and identify the location of the raw water supply for the drinking water system and shall provide as part of the report, i. an indication as to whether the source of the raw water supply is ground water, surface water, or a combination of the two, ii. a site plan showing, A. the boundary of the drinking water system, any significant topographic features within those boundaries, and an indication of site grading that may impact on the source of the raw water supply, B. the location of all parts of the drinking water system used for the collection, storage and treatment of raw water, and C. the distribution system used for distributing treated water to users of the drinking water system, and iii. the information described in paragraph 5 or 6 or both, as the circumstances require. 5. If any part of the source of the raw water supply is ground water, the holder shall, i. include in the site plan the location of any wells that form part of the drinking water system and the location of any known water courses, drains, septic tanks, tile fields and any other structures that may affect the quality of the well water, and ii. include in the site plan a description of the physical characteristics of each well that forms part of the drinking water system including, if available, a copy of the well record, and an indication of whether any of the wells obtains water from a raw water supply that was determined for the purposes of section 2 of the Drinking Water Systems Regulation to be ground water that is under the direct influence of surface water. 6. If any part of the source of the raw water supply is surface water, the holder shall state the name of the surface water body. 7. The holder shall provide in the report a description of the drinking water system, which shall include, at a minimum, i. an estimate of the number of persons served by the drinking water system, ii. a schematic diagram of any treatment process used in the drinking water system for the purpose of meeting the requirements of Schedule 2 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation, and iii. a list of all water treatment equipment and operational check equipment installed in the drinking water system. 8. The opinion that the holder provides for the purposes of subclause 21-5 (b) (i) of Schedule 21 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation respecting whether all equipment required in order to ensure compliance with Schedule 2 to that Regulation is being provided, shall be with respect to all expected flow conditions and quality variations. 9. In addition to the opinions required to be included in the report by section 21-5 of Schedule 21 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation, the holder shall provide in the report his or her opinion regarding, i. the reliability of the water treatment equipment and operational check equipment listed under subparagraph 7 iii and whether there are any redundancies in or observable problems with it, and ii. the operating conditions that must be maintained for the water treatment equipment listed under subparagraph 7 iii in order to ensure that the requirements of Schedule 2 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation are met. 10. The holder shall, i. list in the report all equipment installed or used at the drinking water system, including water treatment equipment and operational check equipment listed under subparagraph 7 iii, that requires periodic maintenance, and ii. review the relevant maintenance records and maintenance schedules that are available for the equipment listed under subparagraph i, and give his or her opinion as to, A. whether the equipment has been inspected, tested, replaced and calibrated at the frequency recommended by the equipment manufacturer, B. if the equipment manufacturer does not recommend a maintenance schedule, whether the existing maintenance schedule for inspection, testing, replacement and calibration of the equipment would provide for reliable operation of the drinking water system, and C. whether the equipment is being inspected, tested, replaced and calibrated so that the drinking water system is in compliance with the applicable requirements set out in Schedules 2, 6, 8 and 9 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation. 11. The holder shall provide reasons for the opinions required to be provided by paragraphs 8, 9 and 10, along with the technical and other information he or she relied on in reaching those opinions. 12. The holder shall attach to the report, i. a list of all available manuals and similar information relevant to the operation and maintenance of the water treatment equipment and operational check equipment listed under subparagraph 10 i, and ii. a list of the water treatment equipment and operational check equipment listed under that subparagraph for which such manuals or information are not available. 13. In preparing the maintenance schedule referred to under clause 21-5 (d) of Schedule 21 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation, the holder shall, subject to paragraph 14, base the maintenance schedule on the applicable maintenance schedules contained in the manuals and information referred to in subparagraph 12 i. 14. If a maintenance schedule for a piece of equipment is not available, or if the holder is of the opinion that the available maintenance schedule would not provide for the reliable operation of the drinking water system or ensure compliance with the applicable requirements of Schedules 2, 6, 8 and 9 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation, the holder shall develop a maintenance schedule for the equipment that would, if followed, provide for such operation and compliance. 15. If the holder determines that water treatment equipment or operational check equipment at a drinking water system may be bypassed, or discovers any other problem with the drinking water system that, in his or her opinion, may lead to improperly treated water being delivered to users of the drinking water system but does not constitute a failure to comply with Schedule 2, 6, 8 or 9 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation, he or she shall include in the report a description of the problem, together with recommendations that would rectify the problem or mitigate risks associated with it. 16. If at any time during the assessment of the drinking water system or the preparation of the report the holder determines that the drinking water system does not comply with a requirement in Schedule 2, 6, 8 or 9 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation and that the lack of compliance may lead to improperly treated water being delivered to users of the drinking water system, he or she shall immediately inform the owner of the drinking water system in writing of the fact, identifying those provisions of the Drinking Water Systems Regulation with which the drinking water system does not comply and the problems that need to be resolved, and recommending changes that would bring the drinking water system into compliance. 17. If the holder makes the determination described in paragraph 16, the holder shall not complete the report, subject to paragraph 18. 18. If the owner of the drinking water system notifies the holder in writing that the changes recommended under paragraph 16 have been made, the holder shall review the changes, and if, in the holder’s opinion, the altered drinking water system is in compliance with Schedules 2, 6, 8 and 9 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation, the holder shall complete the report. 19. On completing a report, the holder shall promptly sign and give to the owner of the drinking water system a declaration, in the form provided for the purpose by the Ministry of the Environment, containing the opinion of the holder that is required to be provided for the purposes of clause 21-5 (b) of Schedule 21 to the Drinking Water Systems Regulation.
