(2) The fee payable for processing the application is the fee payable on January 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the application year, adjusted by the percentage change between, (a) the Ontario Consumer Price Index for the 12-month period immediately preceding the 12-month period described in clause (b); and (b) the Ontario Consumer Price Index for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of the calendar year immediately preceding the application year. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Ontario Consumer Price Index for a 12-month period is the Consumer Price Index for Ontario (All-Items) as reported monthly by Statistics Canada under the authority of the Statistics Act (Canada), averaged over the 12-month period. (4) If the fee determined under subsection (2) results in an amount that is not a multiple of 25 cents, the fee shall be rounded to the nearest quarter of a dollar. (5) Despite subsection (2), if the percentage change in the Ontario Consumer Price Index between the 12-month period referred to in clause (2) (a) and the 12-month period referred to in clause (2) (b) is a negative amount, the fee shall remain the same as it was on January 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the application year and shall not be adjusted. (6) Despite subsection (2), the fee shall remain the same as it was on January 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the application year and shall not be adjusted, unless the Minister determines that the fee as adjusted would not exceed full recovery of the cost of processing applications of the type referred to in subsection 1 (1) or applications of the type referred to in subsection 1 (2), as applicable. (7) Despite subsection (2), the fee shall remain the same as it was on January 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the application year and shall not be adjusted until the Minister publishes, on a Government of Ontario website, a notice specifying the amount of the adjusted fee, as determined under this section, for the application year.
