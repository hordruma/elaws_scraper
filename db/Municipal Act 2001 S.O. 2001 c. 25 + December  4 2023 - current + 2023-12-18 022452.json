An amended restructuring report setting out the amended restructuring proposal must be submitted to the Minister by one of the municipalities or local bodies entitled to make the original restructuring proposal, other than the City of Toronto. 2.  The amended restructuring proposal must have the prescribed degree of support of the prescribed municipalities and local bodies in the geographic area whose support was required for the original restructuring proposal. 3.  The amended restructuring proposal must have the prescribed degree of support of the prescribed municipalities and local bodies in the geographic area whose support would be required if the amended proposal were an original restructuring proposal. 4.  The provisions of any order implementing the original restructuring proposal which are to be amended are not in force.  2006, c. 32, Sched. A, s  83 (1). Same (6) An amended restructuring proposal and report submitted to the Minister under subsection (5) shall be deemed to have been submitted to the Minister under subsection (1) for the purposes of this section.  2001, c. 25, s. 173 (6). Same (7) If the Minister makes an order under subsection (4) or under subsection 149 (4) of the City of Toronto Act, 2006 and then makes another order under subsection (5) implementing an amended restructuring proposal, the second order is deemed to have been made under subsection (4) or under subsection 149 (4) of the City of Toronto Act, 2006, as the case may be, for the purposes of this section.  2006, c. 32, Sched. A, s. 83 (2).

Same, restructuring principles and standards (9) If the Minister is not satisfied that the restructuring proposal and report meet the requirements of this section and comply with the restructuring principles and standards established under section 179, the Minister shall not make an order implementing the proposal and he or she may refer the proposal and report back to the municipality or local body that submitted them for reconsideration.  2001, c. 25, s. 173 (9). Effect of order (10) A restructuring proposal and report shall be deemed to comply with the restructuring principles and standards established under section 179 once an order implementing the proposal is made under subsection (4).  2001, c. 25, s. 173 (10). Filing (11) The Minister shall, (a)  publish an order under subsection (4) in The Ontario Gazette; and (b)  file a copy of an order under subsection (4) with each municipality to which the order applies.  2001, c. 25, s. 173 (11).

F, s. 136 (1).

Differing support requirement (15) A regulation under subsection (14) may provide for different support requirements for restructuring proposals which are minor and restructuring proposals which are not minor.  2001, c. 25, s. 173 (15). Minor restructuring proposal (16) A restructuring proposal is minor if, (a)  the proposal provides for one or more annexations of part of a local municipality to another local municipality and makes any changes to the boundaries of upper-tier municipalities necessary to reflect the annexations; (b)  the proposal does not provide for any type of restructuring other than described in clause (a); and (c)  the Minister, after reviewing the proposal, is of the opinion that it is of a minor nature.  2001, c. 25, s. 173 (16).

Exception, subsequent reassessment (10) Despite subsections (8) and (9), the Minister of Finance may prescribe a new transition ratio, including the average transition ratio, for a taxation year or any previous taxation year for a property class for a municipality and, (a)  for the first year in respect of which the transition ratio is prescribed, the tax ratio may be, (i)  above the allowable range if it is less than or equal to the transition ratio, for the property class for the municipality, that is prescribed or determined in accordance with the regulations, or (ii)  below the allowable range if it is greater than or equal to the transition ratio, for the property class for the municipality, that is prescribed or determined in accordance with the regulations; and (b)  for a subsequent year, the tax ratio may be, (i)  above the allowable range if it is less than or equal to the tax ratio for the property class for the previous year, or (ii)  below the allowable range if it is greater than or equal to the tax ratio for the property class for the previous year.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (10); 2021, c. 40, Sched. 16, s. 1 (1). Average transition ratios (11) For each municipality, the council of which is required to pass a by-law under this section to establish tax ratios, there shall be an average transition ratio for the commercial classes and an average transition ratio for the industrial classes, determined in accordance with the following: 1.  For the first year that an optional property class applies or, subject to subsection (17) or (18), ceases to apply in the municipality, the average transition ratio shall be the average transition ratio that is prescribed or determined in accordance with the regulations. 2.  For a subsequent year, the average transition ratio shall be the weighted average, for the previous year, of the tax ratios for the property classes to which the average transition ratio relates.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (11); 2021, c. 40, Sched. 16, s. 1 (2). If transition ratio is in allowable range for property class (11.1) If the Minister of Finance prescribes a transition ratio for the purposes of this section that is within the allowable range prescribed for a property class, the tax ratio for the property class must be within the allowable range prescribed for the property class.  2006, c. 33, Sched.

Special rule, industrial classes (13) The tax ratio for a property class that is one of the industrial classes may be greater than what would be allowed under subsection (8), (9) or (10) if the following are satisfied: 1.  The tax ratio is less than or equal to the average transition ratio for the industrial classes for the year. 2.  The weighted average, for the year, of the tax ratios for the industrial classes does not exceed the average transition ratio for the industrial classes for the year.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (13). Weighted average (14) For the purposes of subsections (11) to (13), the weighted average, for a year, of the tax ratios for property classes shall be determined as follows: 1.  For each property class, multiply the tax ratio for the property class for the year by the total assessment of the properties in the property class for the year. 2.  Add the amounts determined under paragraph 1 for each property class together. 3.  Add the total assessments of the properties in the property classes for the year, used in the calculation under paragraph 1, together. 4.  The weighted average is the amount determined under paragraph 2 divided by the amount determined under paragraph 3.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (14). Optional classes, regulations (15) The Minister of Finance may make regulations prescribing transition ratios for a year, (a)  for the commercial classes if a municipality opts to have a property class that is one of the commercial classes apply for the year and the property class did not apply within the municipality for the previous year; and (b)  for the industrial classes if a municipality opts to have a property class that is one of the industrial classes apply for the year and the property class did not apply within the municipality for the previous year.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (15). Effect of new transition ratios (16) If new transition ratios are prescribed under subsection (15), paragraph 1 of subsection (9) applies, with necessary modifications, for the year with respect to which they apply.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (16). Opting out, commercial classes (17) If all optional property classes that contain property that would otherwise be in the commercial property class cease to apply for a year in a municipality, the transition ratio for the commercial property class for the year shall be equal to the average transition ratio for the commercial classes for the previous year under subsection (11), and subsection (9) or (10) applies, with necessary modifications, for the year.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (17). Opting out, industrial classes (18) If all optional property classes that contain property that would otherwise be in the industrial property class cease to apply for a year in a municipality, the transition ratio for the industrial property class for the year shall be equal to the average transition ratio for the industrial classes for the previous year under subsection (11), and subsection (9) or (10) applies, with necessary modifications, for the year.  2001, c. 25, s. 308 (18). Regulations, Minister of Finance (19) The Minister of Finance may make regulations, (a)  Repealed:  2009, c. 33, Sched. 21, s. 6 (13).

Definitions (2) In this section, âeligible propertyâ means property classified in any property class prescribed under the Assessment Act; (âbien admissibleâ) âfirst taxation yearâ means a taxation year in respect of which there is a general reassessment; (âpremiÃ¨re annÃ©e dâimpositionâ) âpreceding yearâ means the taxation year immediately preceding the first taxation year. (âannÃ©e prÃ©cÃ©denteâ)  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (2). Tax increase to be phased in (3) If the total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the first taxation year for an eligible property, but for the application of this section, exceed its total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year, the maximum amount of the tax increase to be phased in is the amount of the difference.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (3). Tax decrease to be phased in (4) If the total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year for an eligible property exceed its total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the first taxation year, but for the application of this section, the maximum amount of the tax decrease to be phased in is the amount of the difference.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (4). Amounts to be phased in (5) For properties subject to Part IX and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the taxes for municipal and school purposes for that year shall be determined under subsection 329 (2).  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (5). Same (6) For properties that are not subject to Part IX and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year shall be determined as follows: 1.  Determine the taxes for municipal and school purposes that were levied on the property in the year. 2.  If a supplementary assessment or change in classification was made under section 34 of the Assessment Act during that year or if an assessment or change in classification could have been made under section 34 of that Act and the appropriate change is made to the assessment roll for taxation in the first taxation year, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the increase in the assessment or change in classification, as the case may be, had applied to the property for all of the year. 3.  If the council of a municipality cancels, reduces or refunds taxes under section 357 for the year on an application under clause 357 (1) (a), (c), (d) or (f) or under section 358 for the year, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the event that caused the cancellation, reduction or refund had occurred on January 1 of that year.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (6). Application to lower-tiers (7) A by-law under subsection (1) of an upper-tier municipality also applies with respect to the taxes of its lower-tier municipalities.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (7). Copy (8) An upper-tier municipality shall provide a copy of the by-law under subsection (1) to each lower-tier municipality as soon as is practicable.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (8). By-law requirements (9) A by-law under subsection (1) is subject to the following: 1.  The by-law may apply to the first taxation year and up to the next seven taxation years. 2.  The by-law may replace a by-law made under section 372.2 of the old Act or this section so long as the first-mentioned by-law applies for at least the same number of years as remains outstanding under the by-law made under section 372.2 or this section. 3.  The by-law may modify the phase-in on individual properties subject to a phase-in under a by-law made under section 372.2 of the old Act or this section in order to reflect tax increases or decreases determined under subsection (3) or (4). 4.  The amount to be phased in in a year, other than in the first taxation year, must be the same or less than the amount phased in in the previous year. 5.  The amount phased in in the last year in which a tax increase or decrease is phased in plus the total amounts phased in in the previous years must equal the tax increase or decrease for each property as determined under subsection (3) or (4). 6.  The by-law may treat different property classes differently and it may provide for no phase-ins for some classes but, if the by-law applies to property in a property class, it must apply to all properties in the property class. 7.  For the purposes of paragraph 6, the residential property class, the farm property class and the managed forests property class shall be treated as a single property class. 8.  In the first taxation year, the amounts recovered from all properties in the property class whose tax decreases are being phased in shall not exceed the revenues foregone from all properties in the property class whose tax increases are being phased-in for the municipality referred to in subsection (1). 9.  The by-law may provide for a threshold amount in each taxation year, determined in dollars or as a percentage. 10.  For the purposes of paragraph 9, the threshold amount for eligible properties in a property class in the municipality to which subsection (3) applies may be different from the threshold amount for eligible properties in the property class in the municipality to which subsection (4) applies. 11.  If an assessment is made for a property under subsection 32 (2) or 33 (1) of the Assessment Act in or after the first taxation year but the assessment applies to a year prior to the first taxation year, i.  the by-law made under subsection (1) shall apply to the property, and ii.  the taxes for municipal and school purposes on the property shall be recalculated for the first taxation year and for any subsequent taxation year that is subject to the by-law under subsection (1).  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (9); 2002, c. 22, s. 154. If change in use, character, classification of property (10) If there has been a change in the use or character of any eligible property or in its classification under the Assessment Act that, in the opinion of the council of the municipality, makes a phase-in or the continuation of a phase-in in respect of the property inappropriate, the council may, in the by-law under subsection (1) or in another by-law, exclude such property from the application of the phase-in.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (10). Improvements replaced after scheme begins (11) If an improvement to an eligible property is substantially destroyed before a by-law under subsection (1) is passed and, before the end of the last year in which a tax increase or decrease is phased in, the improvement is replaced, the council of the municipality may amend the by-law under subsection (1) so that the by-law applies to the property as though the improvement had not been substantially destroyed.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (11). Exception (12) Subsection (11) does not apply with respect to an improvement if the destruction of the improvement is by the owner, is permitted by the owner or is done by a person who had a right to destroy the improvement.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (12). No lower-tier surplus or shortfall (13) The council of an upper-tier municipality shall, in a by-law under subsection (1), provide that adjustments shall be made between the upper-tier municipality and lower-tier municipalities so that no lower-tier municipality has a surplus or shortfall as a result of the phase-in of the tax increases or decreases.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (13). Upper-tier shortfall (14) If the upper-tier municipality experiences a shortfall as a result of the application of subsection (13), the by-law made under subsection (1) shall provide that any shortfall shall be shared by the upper-tier municipality and lower-tier municipalities in the same proportion as those municipalities share in the taxes levied on the property class for municipal purposes.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (14). Information on notice of demand (15) A notice of demand of taxes payable in respect of which there is a phase-in shall indicate the amount of taxes that would have been payable without the phase-in, the amount of taxes that are payable and the difference.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (15). List to be kept (16) The treasurer of the local municipality shall maintain a list of the tax increases or decreases for each eligible property to which the by-law under subsection (1) applies.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (16). Application to payments in lieu of taxes (17) This section applies to payments in lieu of taxes, other than an amount referred to in subparagraph 24 iii of subsection 3 (1) of the Assessment Act or an amount received under section 323 or subsection 324 (4) of this Act, as though they were taxes but a by-law under subsection (1) may provide that it does not apply to payments in lieu of taxes.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (17); 2017, c. 10, Sched. 1, s. 41. Taxes for school purposes (18) No phase-in of a tax increase or decrease under this section shall affect the amount a local municipality is required to pay a school board.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (18). Certain changes in first taxation year assessments (19) The following apply if the assessment of an eligible property for the first taxation year changes as a result of a request under section 39.1 of the Assessment Act, an appeal under section 40 of that Act or an application under section 46 of that Act: 1.  The tax increase or decrease for the property shall be redetermined under subsection (3) or (4) using the new assessment for the property. 2.  The taxes on the property shall be recalculated using the amount determined under paragraph 1 for each year in which there is a tax increase or decrease. 3.  The tax roll shall be amended to reflect the recalculated taxes.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (19); 2008, c. 7, Sched. O, s. 1. Certain changes in assessment in preceding year (20) The following apply if the assessment of an eligible property for the preceding year changes as a result of a request under section 39.1 of the Assessment Act, an appeal under section 40 of that Act or an application under section 46 of that Act: 1.  The tax increase or decrease for the property shall be redetermined under subsection (3) or (4) using the new assessment for the property to determine the taxes for the preceding year. 2.  The taxes on the property shall be recalculated using the amount determined under paragraph 1 for each year in which there is a tax increase or decrease. 3.  The tax roll shall be amended to reflect the recalculated taxes.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (20); 2008, c. 7, Sched. O, s. 1. Mixed use (21) If portions of an eligible property are classified in different property classes on the assessment roll for the first taxation year, each portion shall be deemed to be a separate property for the purposes of this section.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (21). Regulations (22) The Minister of Finance may make regulations, (a)  prescribing a later deadline for the purposes of subsection (1), either before or after the deadline has passed; (b)  governing by-laws under this section and the calculation of tax increases and decreases to be phased in under such by-laws.  2001, c. 25, s. 318 (22). Restructuring orders (23) Despite section 151 of the City of Toronto Act, 2006 and section 186 of this Act, a by-law under this section may be made instead of any phase-in authority or requirement set out in an order under section 173 or 175 of this Act or section 149 of the City of Toronto Act, 2006, but the by-law under this section must apply for at least the same number of years as remains outstanding under the phase-in authority or requirement.  2006, c. 32, Sched.

The program must permit the eligible charity to make an application for a rebate for a taxation year based on an estimate of the taxes or amounts on account of taxes payable by the eligible charity on the property it occupies. 5.

The program must require, as a condition of receiving a rebate for a year, that a charity repay any other municipality amounts by which the rebates the charity received for the year from that other municipality exceed the rebates from that other municipality to which the charity is entitled for the year. 7.  An application for a taxation year must be made after January 1 of the year and no later than the last day of February of the following year.  However, the municipality may accept applications after that deadline if, in the opinion of the municipality, extenuating circumstances justify the applicant being unable to make the application by the deadline.  2001, c. 25, s. 361 (3); 2002, c. 22, s. 159 (2-5); 2009, c. 33, Sched. 21, s. 6 (30).

Sharing amounts of rebates (7) The amount of a rebate paid under this section on a property shall be shared by the municipalities and school boards that share in the revenue from the taxes on the property in the same proportion as the municipalities and school boards share in those revenues.  2002, c. 22, s. 159 (7). Statement of costs shared by school boards (8) The municipality that gives a rebate to a charity or similar organization shall also give the charity or similar organization a written statement of the proportion of the costs of the rebate that is shared by school boards.  2001, c. 25, s. 361 (8). Interest (9) The municipality shall pay interest, at the same rate of interest that applies under subsection 257.11 (4) of the Education Act, on the amount of any rebate to which the eligible charity is entitled under this section if the municipality fails to rebate or credit the amount within the time specified in paragraph 3 of subsection (3) or within such other time as the Minister of Finance may prescribe.  2001, c. 25, s. 361 (9). No fee (10) Despite this Act, no fee may be charged by the municipality to process an application under this section.  2001, c. 25, s. 361 (10). Change of assessment (10.1) The following apply if the assessment of an eligible property for a year changes as a result of a request under section 39.1 of the Assessment Act, an appeal under section 40 of that Act, an application under section 46 of that Act or a correction made under subsection 32 (1.1) of that Act: 1.  A rebate under subsection (3) with respect to the year shall be redetermined using the new taxes on property for the year based on the new assessment. 2.  If, as a result of a redetermination under paragraph 1, the amount of the rebate is increased, the increased amount shall be paid to the eligible charity in accordance with this section. 3.  If, as a result of a redetermination under paragraph 1, the amount of the rebate is decreased and amounts paid on account of the rebate exceed the redetermined amount of the rebate, the excess payments are a debt due to the municipality which gave the rebate but the municipality shall not take any action to collect the debt, including the imposition of interest, until 120 days after providing the eligible charity with notice of the debt.  2002, c. 17, Sched. A, s. 64; 2008, c. 7, Sched. O, s. 6; 2017, c. 10, Sched. 1, s. 52.

In respect of a retirement fund by-law for a class of debentures other than a sinking fund or term debenture, in each year an amount equal to or greater than the amount that would have been required for the repayment of the principal of the debentures in that year if the principal had been payable in equal annual instalments and the debentures had been issued for the maximum period authorized by the municipality for the repayment of the debt for which the debentures were issued.  2006, c. 32, Sched. A, s. 177. Principal payable (3) An amount required to be provided in a year under subsection (2) shall be deemed to be an amount of principal payable to the lender in the year for the purposes of subsections 403 (3) and 404 (8) and clause 408 (4) (a).  2002, c. 17, Sched. A, s. 79 (2).

Duty to annually certify balance (6) On or before December 31 in each year, the municipal auditor shall certify the balance in each sinking and retirement fund of a municipality for the year.  2001, c. 25, s. 409 (6).
