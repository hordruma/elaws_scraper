Reg. 437/02, s. 2 (1). (3) The City shall use the tax ratios established by the City under subsection 308 (4) of the Act to calculate with respect to each local municipality levy of the City under section 312 of the Act a separate tax rate on the assessment in each property class in the City rateable for purposes of the local municipality levy.  O. Reg. 437/02, s. 2 (1). (4) The City shall establish and levy, with respect to each upper-tier levy of the County under section 311 of the Act, a separate tax rate on the assessment in each property class in the City rateable for purposes of the upper-tier levy sufficient to raise the City’s portion of the upper-tier levy calculated under section 3 of this Regulation.

O. Reg. 311/01, s. 2 (7); O. Reg. 437/02, s. 2 (4).
