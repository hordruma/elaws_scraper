In these cases, it is necessary to identify the treatment subcategory that most closely describes the particular waste for which treatment is required.  The land disposal treatment requirements for that waste are those shown for that treatment subcategory. 2\r\nHaz. Waste Number means Hazardous Waste Number.  These numbers are consistent with United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Numbers.  If there is no United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Number for a waste, the Hazardous Waste Number is assigned to the waste by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. 3 CAS Number means the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.  When the waste or a regulated constituent is described as a combination of a chemical with its salts or esters, the CAS number is given for the parent compound only. 4 See Schedule 7 for a description of the treatment methods and treatment standards associated with each treatment code.  In some cases, the entries in this Schedule may set out more than one treatment code for a regulated constituent.  An entry may permit a choice of treatment methods.  For example, the entry “CHOXD; BIODG; or CMBST” means that the waste may be treated using any of the treatment methods that are set out for those treatment codes in Schedule 7.  An entry may require treatment methods to be applied in a particular sequence.  For this purpose, the abbreviation “fb” means “followed by”.  For example, the entry “CHOXD fb CARBN” means that the waste must first be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CHOXD in Schedule 7 and, following that treatment, it must be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CARBN in Schedule 7.  An entry may combine a choice of treatment methods and a requirement to apply treatment methods in a particular sequence (for example, “(WETOX or CHOXD) fb CARBN; or CMBST”). 5\r\nConcentration requirements for aqueous wastes are based on analysis of composite samples. 6 Concentration requirements for non-aqueous wastes are based on analysis of grab samples. 7 Both Cyanides (Total) and Cyanides (Amenable) for non-aqueous wastes are to be analyzed using Method 9010 or 9012, found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/ Chemical Methods”, United States Environmental Protection Agency Publication SW–846, with a sample size of 10 grams and a distillation time of one hour and 15 minutes. 7.1\r\nThe manufacturing of complete motor vehicles (body and chassis or unibody) or chassis only at a facility identified by NAICS code 336110 (Automobile and light-duty motor vehicle manufacturing), where “NAICS” means the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Canada 2012, dated January 2012 and maintained for Canada by Statistics Canada. 8 For these wastes, the treatment method described by the CMBST treatment code must be carried out at a facility that is authorized under an environmental compliance approval to treat these types of waste. 9\r\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), United States Congress, 42 U.S.C. s/s 6901 et seq. (1976), Subtitle C, Code of Federal Regulations, 40CFR, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter I - Solid Wastes, Part 261 - Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste. 10\r\nK175 non-aqueous wastes that have been treated in compliance with Schedule 1 land disposal treatment requirements must also be macroencapsulated in accordance with Schedule 8 (Alternative Treatment for Hazardous Debris), unless the waste is placed in: (1) A hazardous waste monofill containing only K175 wastes that meet all applicable Schedule 1 treatment standards; or (2) A dedicated hazardous waste landfill cell in which all other wastes being co-disposed are at pH≤ 6.0.

In these cases, it is necessary to identify the treatment subcategory that most closely describes the particular waste for which treatment is required.  The land disposal treatment requirements for that waste are those shown for that treatment subcategory. 2 Haz. Waste Number means Hazardous Waste Number.  These numbers are consistent with United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Numbers.  If there is no United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Number for a waste, the Hazardous Waste Number is assigned to the waste by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. 3 CAS Number means the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.  When the waste or a regulated constituent is described as a combination of a chemical with its salts or esters, the CAS number is given for the parent compound only. 4 See Schedule 7 for a description of the treatment methods and treatment standards associated with each treatment code.  In some cases, the entries in this Schedule may set out more than one treatment code for a regulated constituent.  An entry may permit a choice of treatment methods.  For example, the entry “CHOXD; BIODG; or CMBST” means that the waste may be treated using any of the treatment methods that are set out for those treatment codes in Schedule 7.  An entry may require treatment methods to be applied in a particular sequence.  For this purpose, the abbreviation “fb” means “followed by”.  For example, the entry “CHOXD fb CARBN” means that the waste must first be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CHOXD in Schedule 7 and, following that treatment, it must be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CARBN in Schedule 7.  An entry may combine a choice of treatment methods and a requirement to apply treatment methods in a particular sequence (for example, “(WETOX or CHOXD) fb CARBN; or CMBST”). 5 Concentration requirements for aqueous wastes are based on analysis of composite samples. 6\r\nConcentration requirements for non-aqueous wastes are based on analysis of grab samples. 7\r\nBoth Cyanides (Total) and Cyanides (Amenable) for non-aqueous wastes are to be analyzed using Method 9010 or 9012, found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/ Chemical Methods”, United States Environmental Protection Agency Publication SW–846, with a sample size of 10 grams and a distillation time of one hour and 15 minutes.

In these cases, it is necessary to identify the treatment subcategory that most closely describes the particular waste for which treatment is required.  The land disposal treatment requirements for that waste are those shown for that treatment subcategory. 2\r\nHaz. Waste Number means Hazardous Waste Number.  These numbers are consistent with United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Numbers.  If there is no United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Number for a waste, the Hazardous Waste Number is assigned to the waste by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. 3 CAS Number means the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.  When the waste or a regulated constituent is described as a combination of a chemical with its salts or esters, the CAS number is given for the parent compound only. 4 See Schedule 7 for a description of the treatment methods and treatment standards associated with each treatment code.  In some cases, the entries in this Schedule may set out more than one treatment code for a regulated constituent.  An entry may permit a choice of treatment methods.  For example, the entry “CHOXD; BIODG; or CMBST” means that the waste may be treated using any of the treatment methods that are set out for those treatment codes in Schedule 7.  An entry may require treatment methods to be applied in a particular sequence.  For this purpose, the abbreviation “fb” means “followed by”.  For example, the entry “CHOXD fb CARBN” means that the waste must first be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CHOXD in Schedule 7 and, following that treatment, it must be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CARBN in Schedule 7.  An entry may combine a choice of treatment methods and a requirement to apply treatment methods in a particular sequence (for example, “(WETOX or CHOXD) fb CARBN; or CMBST”). 5 Concentration requirements for aqueous wastes are based on analysis of composite samples. 6\r\nConcentration requirements for non-aqueous wastes are based on analysis of grab samples.

In these cases, it is necessary to identify the treatment subcategory that most closely describes the particular waste for which treatment is required.  The land disposal treatment requirements for that waste are those shown for that treatment subcategory. 2 Haz. Waste Number means Hazardous Waste Number.  These numbers are consistent with United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Numbers.  If there is no United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Number for a waste, the Hazardous Waste Number is assigned to the waste by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. 3 CAS Number means the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.  When the waste or a regulated constituent is described as a combination of a chemical with its salts or esters, the CAS number is given for the parent compound only. 4 See Schedule 7 for a description of the treatment methods and treatment standards associated with each treatment code.  In some cases, the entries in this Schedule may set out more than one treatment code for a regulated constituent.  An entry may permit a choice of treatment methods.  For example, the entry “CHOXD; BIODG; or CMBST” means that the waste may be treated using any of the treatment methods that are set out for those treatment codes in Schedule 7.  An entry may require treatment methods to be applied in a particular sequence.  For this purpose, the abbreviation “fb” means “followed by”.  For example, the entry “CHOXD fb CARBN” means that the waste must first be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CHOXD in Schedule 7 and, following that treatment, it must be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CARBN in Schedule 7.  An entry may combine a choice of treatment methods and a requirement to apply treatment methods in a particular sequence (for example, “(WETOX or CHOXD) fb CARBN; or CMBST”). 5\r\nConcentration requirements for aqueous wastes are based on analysis of composite samples. 6\r\nConcentration requirements for non-aqueous wastes are based on analysis of grab samples. 7 Both Cyanides (Total) and Cyanides (Amenable) for non-aqueous wastes are to be analyzed using Method 9010 or 9012, found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/ Chemical Methods”, United States Environmental Protection Agency Publication SW–846, with a sample size of 10 grams and a distillation time of one hour and 15 minutes.

Schedule 9   TEST METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF “LIQUID WASTE” (SLUMP TEST)* (1) Sampling Obtain a representative sample of the waste to be tested. (2) Equipment 2.1  Mould — the representative waste sample shall be formed in a mould, in the form of the frustum of a cone with the base 200 mm in diameter, the top 100 mm in diameter, and the height 300 mm. The base and the top shall be open and parallel to each other and at right angles to the axis of the cone. The mould shall be made of a metal that is chemically resistant to the wastes to be tested and that has a thickness that is at least 1.5 mm. It shall be provided with foot pieces and handles as shown in Figure 1. 2.2  Tamping Rod — the rod shall be round, straight and steel with a diameter of 16 mm and a length of 600 mm. One end shall be rounded to a hemispherical tip with a diameter of 16 mm. (3) Procedure 3.1  Dampen the mould and place it on a flat, moist, non-absorbent (rigid) surface. Hold the mould firmly in place during filling by standing on the two foot pieces. From the sample of the material obtained, immediately fill the mould in three layers, each approximately one-third the volume of the mould. Notes: 1)  The test must be carried out at a temperature of not less than 10°C. 2)  One-third of the volume of the slump mould fills it to a depth of 70 mm. Two-thirds of the volume fills it to a depth of 160 mm. 3.2  Rod each layer with 25 strokes of the tamping rod. Uniformly distribute the strokes over the cross-section of each layer.  For the bottom layer this will necessitate inclining the rod slightly and making approximately half of the strokes near the perimeter, and then progressing with vertical strokes spirally toward the center.  Rod layers throughout their depth.  For the second layer and the top layer, the strokes must just penetrate into the underlying layers. 3.3  When filling and rodding the top layer, heap the material above the mould before rodding is started.  If the rodding operation results in subsidence of the material below the top edge of the mould, add additional material to maintain an excess of material above the top of the mould.  After the top layer has been rodded, the excess material shall be screeded off to the level of the top of the mould. Remove the spilled material from the base of the mould. 3.4  Withdraw the mould immediately from the material by raising it carefully in a vertical direction.  The operation of raising the mould shall be performed in approximately 5 seconds by a steady upward lift with no lateral or torsional motion.  The entire operation from the start of the filling through removal of the mould shall be carried out without interruption and shall be completed within 2 minutes. 3.5  Determine the slump immediately after by measuring the difference between the height of the mould and the average height of the top surface of the material after subsidence. Notes: 1)  Waste samples that break or slump laterally give incorrect results.  When this condition occurs, the test shall be repeated with a new sample. 2)  If two consecutive tests on a sample of material show a falling away or shearing off of a portion of the material from the mass of the specimen, the material probably lacks necessary plasticity and cohesiveness for the slump test to be applicable. 3)  Duplicate tests on two different portions of the sample should not vary more than 10 mm. (4) Report 4.1  Record the slump in millimeters to the nearest 10 mm of subsidence of the sample during the test. *  The method is based on the Canadian Standards Association test method for determining the slump of concrete (A23.2-5C)  O.

treatment subcategory that most closely describes the particular waste for which treatment is required.  The land disposal treatment requirements for that waste are those shown for that treatment subcategory.</p> <p class=\"paranoindt-e\"><sup>2</sup> Haz. Waste Number means Hazardous Waste Number.  These numbers are consistent with United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Numbers.  If there is no United States Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Number for a waste, the Hazardous Waste Number is assigned to the waste by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment.</p> <p class=\"paranoindt-e\"><sup>3</sup> CAS Number means the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.  When the waste or a regulated constituent is described as a combination of a chemical with its salts or esters, the CAS number is given for the parent compound only.</p> <p class=\"paranoindt-e\"><sup>4</sup> See Schedule 7 for a description of the treatment methods and treatment standards associated with each treatment code.  In some cases, the entries in this Schedule may set out more than one treatment code for a regulated constituent.  An entry may permit a choice of treatment methods.  For example, the entry “CHOXD; BIODG; or CMBST” means that the waste may be treated using any of the treatment methods that are set out for those treatment codes in Schedule 7.  An entry may require treatment methods to be applied in a particular sequence.  For this purpose, the abbreviation “fb” means “followed by”.  For example, the entry “CHOXD fb CARBN” means that the waste must first be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CHOXD in Schedule 7 and, following that treatment, it must be treated using the treatment method that is set out for CARBN in Schedule 7.  An entry may combine a choice of treatment methods and a requirement to apply treatment methods in a particular sequence (for example, “(WETOX or CHOXD) fb CARBN; or CMBST”).</p> <p class=\"paranoindt-e\"><sup>5</sup>\r\nConcentration

The base and the top shall be open and parallel to each other and at right angles to the axis of the cone. The mould shall be made of a metal that is chemically resistant to the wastes to be tested and that has a thickness that is at least 1.5 mm. It shall be provided with foot pieces and handles as shown in Figure 1.</p> <p class=\"subclause-e\">  2.2  Tamping Rod — the rod shall be round, straight and steel with a diameter of 16 mm and a length of 600 mm.

Hold the mould firmly in place during filling by standing on the two foot pieces. From the sample of the material obtained, immediately fill the mould in three layers, each approximately one-third the volume of the mould.</p> <p class=\"parawindt-e\">  Notes:</p> <p class=\"subsubclause-e\">  1)  The test must be carried out at a temperature of not less than 10°C.</p> <p class=\"subsubclause-e\">  2)  One-third of the volume of the slump mould fills it to a depth of 70 mm. Two-thirds of the volume fills it to a depth of 160 mm.</p> <p class=\"subclause-e\">  3.2  Rod each layer with 25 strokes of the tamping rod. Uniformly distribute the strokes over the cross-section of each layer.  For the bottom layer this will necessitate inclining the rod slightly and making approximately half of the strokes near the perimeter, and then progressing with vertical strokes spirally toward the center.  Rod layers throughout their depth.  For the second layer and the top layer, the strokes must just penetrate into the underlying layers.</p> <p class=\"subclause-e\">  3.3  When filling and rodding the top layer, heap the material above the mould before rodding is started.  If the rodding operation results in subsidence of the material below the top edge of the mould, add additional material to maintain an excess of material above the top of the mould.  After the top layer has been rodded, the excess material shall be screeded off to the level of the top of the mould. Remove the spilled material from the base of the mould.</p> <p class=\"subclause-e\">  3.4  Withdraw the mould immediately from the material by raising it carefully in a vertical direction.  The operation of raising the mould shall be performed in approximately 5 seconds by a steady upward lift with no lateral or torsional motion.  The entire operation from the start of the filling through removal of the mould shall be carried out without interruption and shall be completed within 2 minutes.</p> <p class=\"subclause-e\">  3.5  Determine the slump immediately after by measuring the difference between the height of the mould and the average height of the top surface of the material after subsidence.</p> <p class=\"subsubclause-e\">  Notes:</p> <p class=\"subsubclause-e\">  1)  Waste samples that break or slump laterally give incorrect results.  When this condition occurs, the test shall be repeated with a new sample.</p> <p class=\"subsubclause-e\">  2)  If two consecutive tests on a sample of material show a falling away or shearing off of a portion of the material from the mass of the specimen, the material probably lacks necessary plasticity and cohesiveness for the slump test to be applicable.</p> <p class=\"subsubclause-e\">  3)  Duplicate tests on two different portions of the sample should not vary more than 10 mm.</p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">  (4) Report</p> <p class=\"subclause-e\">  4.1  Record the slump in millimeters to the nearest 10 mm of subsidence of the sample during the test.</p> <div>\n<p class=\"parawtab-e\">*  The method is based on the Canadian Standards Association test method for determining the slump of concrete (A23.2-5C)</p>\n</div> <p align=\"center\" class=\"scanned-e\"><img alt=\"Image of Figure 1 - Mould for Slump Test.
