            "content": " 4.1 (1) An employer of a pension plan that is not an ineligible plan, as described in subsection (25), may elect to defer one or more of the monthly payments of employer contributions that are due during the period beginning on October 1, 2020 and ending on March 31, 2021 in respect of the following: 1.  Normal cost. 2.  The provision for adverse deviations in respect of the normal cost. 3.  All special payments determined in accordance with section 5. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (2) An election under subsection (1) must, (a)  be filed with the Chief Executive Officer in writing, and accompanied by the schedule described in subsection (3), no later than the date on which the contributions for the first deferred month are due; and (b)  specify which monthly payment or payments are deferred and, if more than one monthly payment is deferred, the deferred payments must be in respect of consecutive months. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (3) If an employer makes an election under this section to defer one or more monthly payments, subsection 4 (4) does not apply in respect of the payment or payments and instead the deferred payments shall be made in accordance with a schedule prepared by an actuary that satisfies the following requirements: 1.  The schedule must set out the contributions for each deferred month, determined by the actuary, in respect of the following: i.  Normal cost. ii.  The provision for adverse deviations in respect of the normal cost. iii.  Special payments determined in accordance with section 5. 2.  The schedule must set out the amounts and dates on which the employer will make the deferred payments, and the amounts and dates chosen must comply with the following: i.  50 per cent of the total amount of the payments that would have been required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in the month of October 2020 shall be made, with interest, no later than April 30, 2021 and the remaining amount shall be made, with interest, no later than May 31, 2021. ii.  50 per cent of the total amount of the payments that would have been required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in the month of November 2020 shall be made, with interest, no later than June 30, 2021 and the remaining amount shall be made, with interest, no later than July 31, 2021. iii.  50 per cent of the total amount of the payments that would have been required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in the month of December 2020 shall be made, with interest, no later than August 31, 2021 and the remaining amount shall be made, with interest, no later than September 30, 2021. iv.  50 per cent of the total amount of the payments that would have been required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in the month of January 2021 shall be made, with interest, no later than October 31, 2021 and the remaining amount shall be made, with interest, no later than November 30, 2021. v.  50 per cent of the total amount of the payments that would have been required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in the month of February 2021 shall be made, with interest, no later than December 31, 2021 and the remaining amount shall be made, with interest, no later than January 31, 2022. vi.  50 per cent of the total amount of the payments that would have been required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in the month of March 2021 shall be made, with interest, no later than February 28, 2022 and the remaining amount shall be made, with interest, no later than March 31, 2022. 3.  The schedule must set out the following information, determined by the actuary, in respect of the pension plan as of the first day of the month in which the election is filed: i.  The estimated transfer ratio. ii.  The solvency assets. iii.  The prior year credit balance. iv.  The estimated solvency liabilities. v.  Estimated liabilities for benefits, other than pension benefits and ancillary benefits payable under qualifying annuity contracts, that were excluded in calculating the solvency liabilities. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (4) For clarity, nothing in this section affects an employerâs, or if a person or entity is required to make contributions on behalf of the employer, that person or entityâs obligation under subsection 4 (4) in respect of payments required in respect of the period beginning on April 1, 2021 and ending on March 31, 2022. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (5) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of subsection (3), interest payable in respect of a deferred payment for a particular month begins to accrue on the day on which the payment is, but for the election under this section, required to be made under subsection 4 (4) and ends on the last day of the month in which the payment is required to be made in accordance with the payment schedule. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (6) The interest on the deferred payments shall be calculated at the going concern interest rate or the solvency valuation interest rate, whichever applies in the circumstances, set out in the most recently filed or submitted report under section 3, 4, 13 or 14. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (7) An update to the payment schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the following rules: 1.  The first update must be prepared by an actuary as of the last day of the month that is the third month following the month in which the date on which the first deferred payment would have been required to have been made under subsection 4 (4) had the election not been made. The administrator shall give the update to the Chief Executive Officer no later than 30 days after the last day of the third month. 2.  Subject to paragraph 3, a subsequent update must be prepared by an actuary as of the last day of the third month following the month which included the date as of which the first update was required to be prepared, and subsequent updates must be prepared by an actuary on the last day of every third month thereafter. The administrator shall give the update to the Chief Executive Officer no later than 30 days after the last day of the particular month. 3.  No further updates are required after an update has been given to the Chief Executive Officer that indicates that all deferred payments with interest have been made. 4.  Each update must contain the following information: i.  Information respecting the following: A.  The amount of deferred payments made and interest paid into the pension fund during the three-month period to which the update relates. B.  The amount of the deferred payments to be made and interest to be paid into the pension fund for each of the following that remain outstanding at the end of the three-month period to which the update relates: 1.  Normal cost. 2.  The provision for adverse deviations in respect of the normal cost. 3.  Special payments determined in accordance with section 5. ii.  The following information in respect of the pension plan as of the day on which the update is prepared: A.  The pension planâs estimated transfer ratio. B.  The pension planâs solvency assets. C.  The prior year credit balance. D.  The pension planâs estimated solvency liabilities. E.  Estimated liabilities for benefits, other than pension benefits and ancillary benefits payable under qualifying annuity contracts, that were excluded in calculating the solvency liabilities. iii.  A statutory declaration that is made by an officer of the employer, in a form satisfactory to the Chief Executive Officer, indicating that the employer has complied with the payment schedule with respect to the three-month period to which the update relates and has been in compliance with subsection (11) during that period. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (8) For the purposes of subparagraph 4 iii of subsection (7), the statutory declaration described in that subparagraph shall be provided by the employer to the administrator within 15 days before the update is required to be provided by the administrator to the Chief Executive Officer. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (9) Despite subsection (3), an employer may, at any time, pay an amount equal to the total amount of the deferred payments that remain unpaid, with interest, into the pension fund and if the employer does so, the employer is no longer required to comply with the requirements of this section, including the payment schedule, as of the day the amount is paid into the pension fund. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (10) For the purposes of subsection (9), and despite subsection (5), interest that has accrued in respect of a deferred payment for a particular month in accordance with subsection (5) ends on the last day of the month in which the payment is made and not on the day specified in subsection (5). O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (11) An employer who makes an election under this section shall not do any of the following on or after the day the election is filed and ending on the day on which all of the deferred payments are made and interest is paid in accordance with this section: 1.  Declare or pay any amount, whether as a dividend or a return of capital, on any issued and outstanding share capital of the employer. 2.  Buy back or otherwise purchase or redeem any issued and outstanding share capital of the employer. 3.  Pay a bonus, however described, whether non-discretionary or discretionary, and whether in cash or otherwise, to any executive of the employer. 4.  Increase the compensation of any executive of the employer. 5.  Repay the principal amount of any debt or other obligation of the employer in excess of amounts previously scheduled and agreed to before September 21, 2020. 6.  Pay or credit any amount as a loan or advance to or for the benefit of, i.  any person or entity that beneficially owns any issued and outstanding share capital of the employer or of any related person or entity of the beneficial owner, or ii.  any executive of the employer and any related person or entity of the executive. 7.  Enter into any transaction with a related person or entity in the normal course of business and under terms and conditions that are less favourable to the employer than market terms and conditions. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (12) For clarity, an employer has contravened any of paragraphs 1 to 6 of subsection (11) regardless of whether the terms and conditions of the transaction or action are less, equally or more favourable to the employer as compared to market terms and conditions. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (13) If the employer does any of the following, the amount equal to the total amount of deferred payments that remain unpaid shall be treated as if they were not deferred under this section and shall immediately become due and payable to the pension fund, with interest calculated in accordance with subsection (14): 1.  The employer fails to comply with the payment schedule. 2.  The employer fails to provide the administrator with a statutory declaration as required by subsection (8). 3.  The employer fails to comply with subsection (11). 4.  The employer, or if a person or entity is required to make contributions on behalf of the employer, that person or entity fails to make any of the payments required to be made under subsection 4 (4) in respect of the period beginning on April 1, 2021 and ending on March 31, 2022. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (14) For the purposes of subsection (13), and despite subsection (5), interest that has accrued in respect of a deferred payment for a particular month in accordance with subsection (5) ends on the last day of the month in which the payment is made and not on the day specified in subsection (5). O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (15) Any special payments determined in accordance with section 5 that are deferred by the employer under this section, including interest on these deferred special payments, are deemed not to be excess special payments for purposes of subsection 37 (12). O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (16) The administrator shall not file an amendment to the plan to increase pension benefits or ancillary benefits until after all of the deferred payments are made and interest is paid in accordance with this section, unless the amendment is made to confer a benefit improvement that is required by law or the amendment implements a benefit improvement agreed to in a collective agreement before September 21, 2020. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (17) Subsection (16) applies, whether the benefit improvement is effective before or after September 21, 2020. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (18) The following rules apply to a report under section 3, 4 or 14 that is filed or submitted on or after the day on which the election is filed under this section and before the day on which all the deferred payments are made and interest is paid in accordance with this section: 1.  The report must include a schedule setting out, as of the valuation date, the amount of the deferred payments for each of the following that remain outstanding: i.  Normal cost. ii.  The provision for adverse deviations in respect of the normal cost. iii.  Special payments determined in accordance with section 5. 2.  In respect of the deferred payments that were, before they were deferred, due on or after the valuation date and were made on or after the valuation date, the report must also include the amount of the deferred payments, with interest, that would have been required under the report. 3.  Payments that have been deferred and, before they were deferred, were due before the date the report was filed or submitted, cannot be reduced and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any solvency special payments that are deferred may not be reduced by applying the solvency excess under subsection 5 (17.1) and any going concern special payments that are deferred may not be reduced by applying the going concern excess under section 7.0.1. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (19) In respect of a report under section 3, 4 or 14 that is filed or submitted on or after the day on which the election is filed under this section and for which the valuation date of the report is before the day on which all the deferred payments are made and interest is paid in accordance with this section, the following rules apply in respect of contributions that were, before they were deferred under this section, due before the valuation date: 1.  Clause (a) of the definition of âgoing concern assetsâ in subsection 1 (2) includes the present value of all deferred payments that have not been made as of the valuation date, except deferred payments in respect of special payments for any solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency that were, before they were deferred, due after the valuation date. 2.  In respect of a pension plan for which a benefit allocation method is used, the solvency asset adjustment must include the present value of all deferred payments that have not been made as of the valuation date. 3.  In respect of a pension plan for which a benefit allocation method is not used, the definition of âCâ in subsection 1.2 (2) and the definition of âEâ in subsection 1.2 (2.2) must not include the value of deferred payments that have not been made as of the valuation date. 4.  In respect of a pension plan for which a benefit allocation method is not used, the definition of âDâ in subsection 1.2 (2.1) must include the present value of all deferred payments relating to solvency payments that have not been made as of the valuation date. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1); O. Reg. 533/21, s. 3. (20) In the annual statement to be given to members of the pension plan under subsection 27 (1) of the Act and in the biennial statement to be given to the former members and retired members of the pension plan under subsection 27 (2) of the Act, in addition to the information required by section 40, 40.1 or 40.2 of this Regulation, as the case may be, the administrator shall include a statement that the employer has elected to defer the payment of certain contributions and the date by which all the deferred payments will be made by the employer, with interest. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (21) Subsection (20) applies on and after the day the election is filed under this section and before the day on which all the deferred payments are made and interest is paid in accordance with this section. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (22) The following additional rules apply if the valuation date of a report referred to in subsection 12 (1) is before March 31, 2021: 1.  The amounts required to be paid under subsection 12 (2) shall be calculated as if the deferred payments, as determined under the report, that are required to be made in accordance with the payment schedule after the report is filed or submitted were made on the dates that they would have been required to be made if they had not been deferred. 2.  If any deferred payments are in respect of a month or part of a month that falls after the filing date, the following rules apply: i.  A new schedule shall be prepared by an actuary setting out the information required under paragraph 2 of subsection (3) in respect of the deferred payments that are required to be made in accordance with the original schedule after the filing date, reflecting the amounts set out in the report. ii.  The employer shall file the new schedule with the Chief Executive Officer no later than the date on which the report is filed. iii.  As of the date the new schedule is filed, the payment schedule originally prepared under subsection (3) is deemed to no longer be the payment schedule for the purposes of this section and the new schedule is deemed to be the payment schedule for the purposes of this section. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (23) The following modifications to subsection 5 (16) apply: 1.  The total amount of contributions referred to in the definition of âBâ shall not include any payments made in respect of interest on contributions that are deferred under this section. 2.  The total amount of contributions referred to in the definition of âCâ shall not include any contributions required to be made that were deferred and not yet made as of the valuation date for the report or actuarial cost certificate being prepared, but shall include the value of required contributions that were due before the valuation date for the report or actuarial cost certificate being prepared but were deferred under this section until after the valuation date of the last report or actuarial cost certificate filed or submitted in respect of the plan under this Regulation. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (24) For the purposes of subsection 4 (3.2), the amount of the excess contributions in respect of any deferred payments made under this section is equal to the difference between the contributions made, including interest, and the amount of the deferred payments, including interest, that would have been required to be made if the deferred payments had been made based on the report being filed. O. Reg. 520/20, s. 1 (1). (25) A plan is an ineligible plan for the purposes of subsection (1) if any of the following apply: 1.  The employer of the plan has done any of the things described in paragraphs 1 to 7 of subsection (11) on or after September 21, 2020, except if the employer had a contractual obligation under an agreement that was executed before September 21, 2020 to do the thing before an election is made under this section. 2.

O. Reg. 250/18, s. 10 (3); O. Reg. 533/21, s. 4 (3). (1.0.2) Clause (1.0.0.1) (b) applies, and clause (1.0.0.1) (e) does not apply, with respect to an increase in the going concern unfunded liability that results from an amendment that, (a)  is made to confer a benefit improvement that is required by law; (b)  is filed before May 1, 2018; or (c)  implements a benefit improvement agreed to in a collective agreement before May 1, 2018 if the collective agreement is in place immediately before that date. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 10 (3). (1.1) Despite subsections (1) and (1.0.0.1), in the case of a jointly sponsored pension plan, the special payments may be determined in accordance with subsection (1.2) as of, (a)  the date the going concern unfunded liability arose, in the case of special payments referred to in clauses (1) (b) and (1.0.0.1) (a), (b), (c) and (d); (b)  the date of an amendment to a pension plan that increases going concern liabilities, in the case of special payments referred to in clause (1.0.0.1) (e); or (c)  t the date the solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency arose, in the case of special payments referred to in clauses (1) (e) and (1.0.0.1) (f) and (g). O. Reg. 250/18, s. 10 (4); O. Reg. 533/21, s. 4 (4). (1.2) The special payments referred to in subsection (1.1) are determined under the following rules: 1.  Each scheduled payment must be a level percentage of the sum of pensionable earnings of the members of the pension plan at the valuation date projected to the date when the scheduled payments commence and, after that date, projected annually until the end of the amortization period without reference to, i.  changes in the membership of the plan that may occur after the valuation date and that arise from termination of employment or membership, the retirement or death of members or the addition of new members to the plan, or ii.  any other changes in the membership of the plan that may occur after the valuation date. 1.1  Despite paragraph 1, if there is reason to believe that there will be a material decline in the number of members before the end of the amortization period, the sum in paragraph 1 of the projected pensionable earnings must reflect the expected decline in the sum of projected pensionable earnings. 2.  The sum in paragraph 1 of the projected pensionable earnings must be determined based on actuarial assumptions that are consistent with those used to project pensionable earnings in the going concern valuation based on the benefit allocation method. 3.  The present value of the scheduled payments at the date described in subsection (1.1) must be equal to the amount of the going concern unfunded liability, increase in going concern liabilities due to an amendment to the pension plan, reduced solvency deficiency or solvency deficiency being liquidated. 4.  The amortization periods for each series of scheduled payments must be the same as the respective periods under clauses (1) (b) and (e) and subsection (1.0.0.1), beginning not later than 12 months after the valuation date. 5.  The present value of the scheduled payments must be determined, i.  with respect to any going concern unfunded liability, using the interest rate or rates used in the report to determine the going concern unfunded liability, ii.  for a report with a valuation date on or after December 31, 2017 with respect to any going concern unfunded liability or increase in going concern liabilities due to an amendment to a pension plan, using the interest rate or rates used in the report to determine the going concern unfunded liabilities or increase in going concern liabilities due to the amendment, and iii.  with respect to any solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency, using the interest rates used in the report to determine the solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency.

(2) The rates of interest to be used in calculating the special payments under clauses (1) (e) and (1.0.0.1) (f) and (g) with respect to a solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency are the rates used in the report under section 14 in which the solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency was determined for the applicable portions of the amortization period for the special payments. O. Reg. 533/21, s. 4 (7). (3) If an employer provides a letter of credit under section 55.2 of the Act instead of making payments into the pension fund with respect to a solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency, the employer is required to make interest payments with respect to the solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency, calculated at the rate of interest described in subsection (2), unless the interest payments are included in the amount of the letter of credit.

(1) A multi-employer pension plan established pursuant to a collective agreement or trust agreement or a pension plan that provides defined benefits where the obligation of an employer to contribute to the pension plan is limited to a fixed amount set out in a collective agreement shall include a provision for the funding of pension benefits and any other benefits provided under the plan that sets out the obligation of an employer or any person required to make contributions on behalf of the employer to contribute in respect of the plan.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 909, s. 6 (1). (2) An employer or any person required to make contributions on behalf of an employer with respect to a pension plan referred to in subsection (1) shall make payments to the pension fund or the insurance company, as applicable, that are not less than, (a)  any contributions received from employees including money withheld from an employee, whether by payroll deduction or otherwise as the employeeâs contribution to the pension plan; and (b)  such amounts set out in the applicable collective agreement as are required to be paid by the employer or the person required to make contributions on behalf of the employer.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 909, s. 6 (2). (3) The payments referred to in subsection (2) shall be made within the following time limits: 1.  All sums received by the employer from an employee or deducted from an employeeâs pay as the employeeâs contribution to the pension plan, within thirty days after the month in which the sum was received or deducted. 2.  All amounts, other than those referred to in paragraph 1, within the time limit specified by the applicable collective agreement but, in any event, within thirty days after the month in which the period of employment giving rise to such payments occurred.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 909, s. 6 (3). (4) In the case of a pension plan referred to in subsection (1), the actuary shall, as part of the report required under subsection 3 (1) or section 13 or 14, (a)  perform such tests as will demonstrate the sufficiency of the contributions required by the collective agreement or agreements to provide for the benefits set out in the plan without consideration of any provision for reduction of benefits set out in the plan; or (b)  where the contributions are not sufficient to provide the benefits under the plan, propose options available to the administrator of the plan that will have the result that the required contributions will be sufficient to provide the benefits under the plan.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 909, s. 6 (4). (4.1) For the purposes of clause (4) (a), the sufficiency of the required contributions is to be determined on the basis of a going concern valuation and a solvency valuation.  O. Reg. 489/07, s. 1 (1). (4.2) For the purposes of clause (4) (a) for a report with a valuation date before December 31, 2017, the required contributions are sufficient if, for each year of the period covered by the report, they are not less than the sum of the following amounts, determined using a benefit allocation method: 1.  The normal cost of the plan. 2.  The special payments set out in a previous report that remain to be paid with respect to any going concern unfunded liability. 3.  The special payments set out in a previous report that remain to be paid with respect to any solvency deficiency. 4.  The special payments to be paid with respect to any going concern unfunded liability that is determined in the report. 5.  The special payments to be paid with respect to any solvency deficiency that is determined in the report.  O. Reg. 489/07, s. 1 (1); O. Reg. 250/18, s. 16 (2). (4.3) For the purposes of clause (4) (a) for a report with a valuation date on or after December 31, 2017, the required contributions are sufficient if, for each year of the period covered by the report, they are not less than the sum of the following amounts, determined using a benefit allocation method: 1.  The normal cost of the plan. 2.  The amount equal to the provision for adverse deviations in respect of the normal cost of the plan. 3.  The special payments set out in a previous report to be paid in the year following the valuation date with respect to any going concern unfunded liability, other than special payments for a past service unfunded actuarial liability set out in a previous report with a valuation date on or after December 31, 2017. 4.  The special payments set out in a previous report with a valuation date on or after December 31, 2017 that remain to be paid in respect of any amendment that increases the going concern liabilities or past service unfunded actuarial liability. 5.  The special payments set out in a previous report that remain to be paid with respect to any solvency deficiency or reduced solvency deficiency. 6.  The special payments to be paid with respect to any going concern unfunded liability that is determined in the report. 7.  The special payments to be paid with respect to any plan amendment that increases going concern liabilities or past service unfunded actuarial liability that is determined in the report. 8.  The special payments to be paid with respect to any reduced solvency deficiency that is determined in the report. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 16 (3); O. Reg. 533/21, s. 7 (2). (4.4) If the payments required under subsection (4.3) are greater than they would have been under subsection (4.2) as it read immediately before May 1, 2018, the required contributions are sufficient if, for each year of the period covered by the report, they are not less than the amount calculated using the formula, A â [(AâB) Ã C] in which, âAâ  is the total of the payments required under subsection (4.3) for the year based on the most recent report filed, âBâ  is the total of the payments that would have been required for the year under subsection (4.2) as it read immediately before May 1, 2018, âCâ  is the value described in subsection (4.5).

For a pension plan that provides defined benefits where the obligation of the employer to contribute to the pension fund is limited to a fixed amount set out in a collective agreement that exists on May 1, 2018: i.  The value of âCâ is equal to one in the year that is the earlier of, A.  2021, and B.  the year in which the collective agreement expires. ii.

In the first year following the valuation date of the first report filed with a valuation date that is on or after December 31, 2017, the value of âCâ is equal to one. ii.  In the year immediately following the year described in subparagraph i, the value of âCâ is equal to 0.667. iii.  In the year immediately following the year described in subparagraph ii, the value of âCâ is equal to 0.333. iv.  In any year following the year described in subparagraph iii, the value of âCâ is zero. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 16 (3). (5) Where an actuary proposes options in accordance with clause (4) (b), (a)  the actuary shall submit a copy of the report containing the proposed options to the administrator; (b)  the actuary shall file a copy of the report within thirty days after submitting the report to the administrator and within the time period referred to in subsection 14 (10); (c)  the administrator shall take such action as will result in the plan meeting the funding requirements of this section within ninety days after the date on which the actuary submitted the report to the administrator; and (d)  the administrator shall advise the Chief Executive Officer of the action taken in order for the plan to meet the funding requirements of this section within 120 days after the date the actuary submitted the report to the administrator and shall file all documents relevant to the action taken.

O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25; O. Reg. 105/19, s. 17 (2). (3) The value of âBâ for the purposes of subsection (2) is the value determined under Table 1 to this section based on the planâs combined target asset allocation for non-fixed income assets, as determined under subsection (4), in accordance with the following rules: 1.  The value of âBâ is the value in Column 3 or Column 4 of Table 1, whichever applies, opposite the combined target asset allocation for the non-fixed income assets of the plan under Column 2 of Table 1. 2.  If the combined target asset allocation for non-fixed income assets falls between two values in Column 2 of Table 1, the value of âBâ shall be interpolated linearly from the values in Column 3 or 4 of Table 1, whichever applies.

O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25. (5) For the purposes of determining the value of âCâ under subsection (2), the value equal to the planâs duration of going concern liabilities shall be calculated using the formula, (F â G) / (G Ã 0.01) in which, âFâ  is the value of the planâs going concern liabilities as of the valuation date, determined using a discount rate that is 1 per cent less than the discount rate used in the report, and âGâ  is the value of the planâs going concern liabilities as of the valuation date. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25.

O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25. (7) For the purposes of determining the value of âEâ under subsection (2), the planâs benchmark discount rate is the amount calculated using the formula, 0.005 + H + (0.015 Ã J) + (0.05 Ã K) in which, âHâ  is the benchmark yield on long-term bonds issued by the Government of Canada for the valuation date, as determined from the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System (CANSIM) series V39056 compiled by Statistics Canada and available on the website of the Bank of Canada, âJâ  is the combined target asset allocation for fixed income assets, determined under subsection (8), and âKâ  is the combined target asset allocation for non-fixed income assets, determined under subsection (4). O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25. (8) Subject to subsections (9) to (11), for the purposes of the value of âJâ in subsections (4) and (7), the planâs combined target asset allocation for fixed income assets shall be determined in accordance with the formula, [L + (0.5 Ã M) + (N Ã P) + (0.5 Ã N Ã Q)] / (100% â R) in which, âLâ  is the sum of the planâs target asset allocations for each of the investment categories listed in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5, 15 and 16 of subsection 76 (12), excluding any portions of the target asset allocations that are allocated to the assets described in âRâ, expressed as a percentage, âMâ  is the sum of the planâs target asset allocations for each of the investment categories listed in paragraphs 6 to 11 and 17 of subsection 76 (12), excluding any portions of the target asset allocations that are allocated to the assets described in âRâ, expressed as a percentage, âNâ  is the planâs target asset allocation for the investment category listed in paragraph 2 of subsection 76 (12), expressed as a percentage, âPâ  is the proportion of âNâ that is allocated to the investment categories listed in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5, 15 and 16 of subsection 76 (12), expressed as a percentage, âQâ  is the proportion of âNâ that is allocated to the investment categories listed in paragraphs 6 to 11 and 17 of subsection 76 (12), expressed as a percentage, and âRâ  is the portion of the planâs target asset allocation for each investment category listed in paragraphs 1, 3 to 11 and 15 to 17 of subsection 76 (12), expressed as a percentage, that is allocated to annuity contracts that have been purchased from an insurance company in respect of benefits. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25. (9) In determining the values of âLâ and âPâ in subsection (8), any portion of a target asset allocation for an investment category listed in paragraph 4, 15 or 16 of subsection 76 (12) shall not be included unless the following criteria are met: 1.  The planâs statement of investment policies and procedures must set out a minimum rating for target asset allocations of fixed income assets in the investment category, or the portion thereof, that is given by a credit rating agency recognized by a competent authority. 2.  As of the valuation date referred to in subsection (2), the minimum rating described in paragraph 1 must be at or above one of the following ratings: i.  The rating set out in Column 3 or 4 of Table 2 to this section, as applicable, opposite a credit rating agency in Column 2 of that Table. ii.  A rating that is equivalent to the rating described in subparagraph i and that is given by another credit rating agency recognized by a competent authority. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25; O.

Reg. 105/19, s. 17 (6). (9.2) Any portion of a target asset allocation excluded from the value of âPâ in subsection (8) in accordance with subsection (9) shall be included in the value of âQâ in subsection (8). O. Reg. 105/19, s. 17 (6). (10) The target asset allocation to be used in determining the values of âLâ, âMâ, âNâ, âPâ, âQâ and âRâ in subsection (8) is the target asset allocation in the planâs statement of investment policies and procedures that is in effect as of the valuation date referred to in subsection (2). O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25; O. Reg. 105/19, s. 17 (7). (11) Subject to subsection (12), for a report with a valuation date before December 31, 2019, a planâs actual asset allocations to the applicable investment categories on the valuation date of the report, as set out in the planâs financial statements, may be used instead of the planâs target asset allocations in determining the values of âLâ, âMâ, âNâ, âPâ, âQâ and âRâ in subsection (8). O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25. (12) If a planâs actual asset allocations are used under subsection (11), any asset in an investment category listed in paragraph 4, 15 or 16 of subsection 76 (12) shall not be included unless, as of the valuation date referred to in subsection (2), the minimum rating of the asset is at or above one of the following ratings: 1.  The rating set out in Column 3 or 4 of Table 2 to this section, as applicable, opposite a credit rating agency in Column 2 of that Table. 2.  A rating that is equivalent to the rating described in paragraph 1 and that is given by another credit rating agency recognized by a competent authority. O. Reg. 250/18, s. 25; O.

(âtaux de rendement de la caisse de retraiteâ)  O. Reg. 178/12, s. 23 (2); O. Reg. 287/20, s. 6. (2) The following rules govern the crediting of interest on contributions made by or on behalf of members, former members and retired members to a pension plan that provides defined contribution benefits: 1.  Crediting of interest:  The contributions and additional voluntary contributions made to the pension fund by or on behalf of members, former members and retired members must be credited, at least annually, with interest calculated in accordance with this subsection. 2.  Accrual:  The interest on a contribution begins to accrue no later than the first day of the month after the month in which the contribution must be paid into the pension fund or, in the case of an additional voluntary contribution, no later than the first day of the month after the month in which the contribution is paid into the pension fund. 3.  Rate:  The interest on contributions, other than additional voluntary contributions, must be calculated at a rate that is not less than the pension fund rate of return.  However, if the pension benefits are guaranteed by an insurance company, interest on the contributions must be calculated at a rate that is not less than the bank deposit rate. 4.  Rate for additional voluntary contributions:  The interest on additional voluntary contributions must be calculated at the pension fund rate of return. 5.  Averaging the rate:  When crediting contributions or additional voluntary contributions made during a fiscal year of a pension plan, the administrator may use an average rate for that fiscal year determined in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4 instead of the particular rate in effect when the interest is accrued.

(3) The following rules govern the crediting of interest on contributions made by members, former members and retired members to a pension plan that provides defined benefits: 1.  Crediting of interest:  The contributions and additional voluntary contributions made to the pension fund by members, former members and retired members must be credited, at least annually, with interest calculated in accordance with this subsection. 2.  Accrual:  The interest on a contribution begins to accrue no later than the first day of the month after the month in which the contribution must be paid into the pension fund or, in the case of an additional voluntary contribution, no later than the first day of the month after the month in which the contribution is paid into the pension fund. 3.  Rate:  The interest on contributions, other than additional voluntary contributions, must be calculated at a rate that is not less than the bank deposit rate.  However, there are two exceptions to this requirement.  If the pension plan so provides, the interest on the contributions may be calculated at a rate that is not less than the pension fund rate of return.  If the pension benefits are guaranteed by an insurance company, interest on the contributions must be calculated at a rate that is not less than the bank deposit rate. 4.  Rate for additional voluntary contributions:  The interest on additional voluntary contributions must be calculated at such rate of return as can reasonably be attributed to the operation of the pension fund or to the part of the pension fund to which the contributions are made. 5.
