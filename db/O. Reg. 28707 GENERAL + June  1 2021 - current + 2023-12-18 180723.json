An explanation of the source protection committee’s reasons for designating an activity under paragraph 1 of subsection 22 (3) of the Act, including the reasons relied on by the committee to form the opinion that the activity must be prohibited in order to ensure that it ceases to be a significant drinking water threat. 3.  A summary of the comments received under sections 35 to 39 and an explanation of how the comments affected the development of the policies set out in the source protection plan. 4.  An explanation of how the summary referred to in paragraph 7 of subsection 13 (1) affected the development of the policies set out in the source protection plan. 5.  A summary of how the consideration of the potential financial implications for persons and bodies who would be implementing or affected by the source protection plan influenced the development of the policies set out in the plan. 6.
