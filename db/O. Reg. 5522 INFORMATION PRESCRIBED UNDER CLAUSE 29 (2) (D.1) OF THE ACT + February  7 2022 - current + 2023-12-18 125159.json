If the member has been charged with an offence under the Criminal Code (Canada), the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) or similar legislation in another jurisdiction and the charge is outstanding, i.  the fact and content of the charge, ii.  the date and place of the charge, and iii.  any currently existing conditions of release following the charge or any variations to those conditions. (2) The Registrar may consider the following factors when determining if information referred to in subsection (1) in respect of a member who has been charged with or found guilty of an offence under the Criminal Code (Canada), the\r\nControlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) or similar legislation in another jurisdiction is relevant to the member’s membership: 1.  Whether including the information on the register is necessary to serve and protect the public interest. 2.  Whether the conduct that led to the charge occurred in the course of the member’s practice. 3.  Whether the conduct relates to a ground of professional misconduct under the Act. 4.  Whether the conduct that led to the charge relates to the member’s suitability to practise, particularly with respect to being in a position of trust or authority in relation to a child. 5.  Any additional relevant factors, as determined by the Registrar. (3) The information referred to in paragraph 1 of subsection (1) shall not be contained in the register in respect of a member if it is known to the College that, (a)  the Parole Board of Canada has ordered a record suspension in respect of the conviction; (b)  a pardon in respect of the conviction has been obtained; or (c)  the conviction has been overturned on appeal. (4) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as authorizing the disclosure of identifying information about an individual other than a member.
