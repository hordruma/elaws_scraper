(5) The board’s distance factor per pupil is the amount determined by multiplying the urban factor specified for the board in Column 3 of Table 6 by the amount determined under the following paragraph that applies to the board: 1. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is less than 151 kilometres, the amount is zero. 2. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 151 kilometres but less than 650 kilometres, the amount is determined using the following formula: (A – 150) × $1.08758 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 3. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 650 kilometres but less than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is determined using the following formula: [(A – 650) × $0.14638] + $543.79 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 4. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is $616.98.

If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 7 is equal to or greater than 650 kilometres but less than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is determined using the following formula: [(A – 650) × $0.14638] + $543.79 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 7. 4. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 7 is equal to or greater than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is $616.98. (7) The board’s dispersion amount is the sum of the following amounts: 1. The amount calculated in respect of elementary school pupils of the board under subsection (8). 2. The amount calculated in respect of secondary school pupils of the board under subsection (9). (8) The amount referred to in paragraph 1 of subsection (7) is calculated using the following formula: 2/3 × [(CC – E) × ADEE × $5.72251] + 1/3 × [(DD – F) × ADEE × $5.72251] in which, “CC”  is the dispersion distance in kilometres set out in Column 4 of Table 6 opposite the name of the board in Column 1 of that Table, “DD” is the dispersion distance in kilometres set out in Column 4 of Table 7 opposite the name of the board in Column 1 of that Table, “E” is the lesser of “CC” and 14 kilometres, “F” is the lesser of “DD” and 14 kilometres, and “ADEE” is the 2015-2016 day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils of the board. (9) The amount referred to in paragraph 2 of subsection (7) is calculated using the following formula: 2/3 × [(CC – E) × ADES × $5.72251] + 1/3 × [(DD – F) × ADES × $5.72251] in which, “CC”  is the dispersion distance in kilometres set out in Column 4 of Table 6 opposite the name of the board in Column 1 of that Table, “DD” is the dispersion distance in kilometres set out in Column 4 of Table 7 opposite the name of the board in Column 1 of that Table, “E” is the lesser of “CC” and 14 kilometres, “F” is the lesser of “DD” and 14 kilometres, and “ADES” is the 2015-2016 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board.",

(4) For the purposes of this section, the number of teachers employed by a board is the full-time equivalent number of persons employed by the board as of October 31, 2015 to teach. (5) The following rules apply to the counting of teachers for the purposes of subsection (4): 1. If a teacher is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2015 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils of the board and is also assigned, as of that date, under section 17 of Regulation 298 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Operation of Schools — General) made under the Act, to spend part of his or her time acting as a consultant, co-ordinator or supervisor, the full-time equivalency for the teacher is determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31, 2015 for which the teacher is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils of the board or to prepare for such instruction. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a count of hours is accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the total determined under subparagraph i by 5. 2. If a principal or vice-principal is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2015 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils of the board, the principal or vice-principal is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section and his or her full-time equivalency as a teacher is determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31, 2015 for which the principal or vice-principal is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils of the board.

If a board uses an AEFO certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that AEFO certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 2. If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2015 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2015-2016 school year and October 31, 2015, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. 9. The 2005 Data Form A, referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, is available as described in subsection 3 (6). O. Reg. 195/15, s. 41 (9); O. Reg. 219/16, s. 8 (10). (10) Revoked: O.
