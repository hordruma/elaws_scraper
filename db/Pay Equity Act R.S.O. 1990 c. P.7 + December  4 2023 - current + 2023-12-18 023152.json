Idem (3) A pay equity plan shall provide that the female job class or classes that have, at any time during the implementation of the plan, the lowest job rate shall receive increases in rates of compensation under the plan that are greater than the increases under the plan for other female job classes until such time as the job rate for the female job class or classes receiving the greater increases is equal to the lesser of, (a) the job rate required to achieve pay equity; and (b) the job rate of the female job class or classes entitled to receive an adjustment under the plan with the next lowest job rate.

Transition, application (7.1) Subsections (7.2) and (7.3) apply with respect to an employer in the public sector who has set out in a pay equity plan that was posted or in another agreement that was made before this subsection comes into force a schedule of compensation adjustments for achieving pay equity. Same, bargaining agent (7.2) If the employees to whom the plan or agreement applies are represented by a bargaining agent, the employer is not bound by the schedule set out in it if the employer gives written notice to the bargaining agent that the employer wishes to enter into negotiations concerning a replacement schedule. Same, no bargaining agent (7.3) The employer is not bound by the schedule set out in the plan or agreement if the employees to whom it applies are not represented by a bargaining agent.  1993, c. 4, s. 7 (1). Definition (8) In this section, “payroll” means the total of all wages and salaries payable to the employees in Ontario of the employer. Pay equity plan binding (9) A pay equity plan that is approved under this Part binds the employer and the employees to whom the plan applies and their bargaining agent, if any.
