Â 2006, c.Â 11, Sched.Â A, s.Â 282Â (1). Definitions (2) In this section, âeligible propertyâ means property classified in any property class prescribed under the Assessment Act; (âbien admissibleâ) âfirst taxation yearâ means a taxation year in respect of which there is a general reassessment; (âpremiÃ¨re annÃ©e dâimpositionâ) âpreceding yearâ means the taxation year immediately preceding the first taxation year. (âannÃ©e prÃ©cÃ©denteâ)  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 282 (2). Tax increase to be phased in (3) If the total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the first taxation year for an eligible property, but for the application of this section, exceed its total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year, the maximum amount of the tax increase to be phased in is the amount of the difference.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 282 (3). Tax decrease to be phased in (4) If the total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year for an eligible property exceed its total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the first taxation year, but for the application of this section, the maximum amount of the tax decrease to be phased in is the amount of the difference.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 282 (4). Amounts to be phased in (5) For properties subject to Part XII (Limits on Traditional Municipal Taxes) and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the taxes for municipal and school purposes for that year shall be determined under subsection 291 (2).  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 282 (5). Same (6) For properties that are not subject to Part XII (Limits on Traditional Municipal Taxes) and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year shall be determined as follows: 1. Determine the taxes for municipal and school purposes that were levied on the property in the year. 2. If a supplementary assessment or change in classification was made under section 34 of the Assessment Act during that year or if an assessment or change in classification could have been made under section 34 of that Act and the appropriate change is made to the assessment roll for taxation in the first taxation year, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the increase in the assessment or change in classification, as the case may be, had applied to the property for all of the year. 3. If city council cancels, reduces or refunds taxes under section 323 for the year on an application under clause 323 (1) (a), (c), (d) or (f) or under section 325 for the year, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the event that caused the cancellation, reduction or refund had occurred on January 1 of that year.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 282 (6). By-law requirements (7) A by-law under subsection (1) is subject to the following: 1. The by-law may apply to the first taxation year and up to the next seven taxation years. 2. The by-law may replace a by-law made under section 318 of the Municipal Act, 2001\r\nor made under this section so long as the first-mentioned by-law applies for at least the same number of years as remains outstanding under the by-law made under section 318 or this section. 3. The by-law may modify the phase-in on individual properties subject to a phase-in under a by-law made under section 318 of the Municipal Act, 2001 or made under this section in order to reflect tax increases or decreases determined under subsection (3) or (4). 4. The amount to be phased in in a year, other than in the first taxation year, must be the same or less than the amount phased in in the previous year. 5. The amount phased in in the last year in which a tax increase or decrease is phased in plus the total amounts phased in in the previous years must equal the tax increase or decrease for each property as determined under subsection (3) or (4). 6. The by-law may treat different property classes differently and it may provide for no phase-ins for some classes but, if the by-law applies to property in a property class, it must apply to all properties in the property class. 7. For the purposes of paragraph 6, the residential property class, the farm property class and the managed forests property class shall be treated as a single property class. 8. In the first taxation year, the amounts recovered from all properties in the property class whose tax decreases are being phased in shall not exceed the revenues foregone from all properties in the property class whose tax increases are being phased-in for the City. 9. The by-law may provide for a threshold amount in each taxation year, determined in dollars or as a percentage. 10. For the purposes of paragraph 9, the threshold amount for eligible properties in a property class in the City to which subsection (3) applies may be different from the threshold amount for eligible properties in the property class in the City to which subsection (4) applies. 11.

The program must provide that payment of one-half of the rebate must be made within 60 days after the receipt by the City of the application of the eligible charity for the rebate for the taxation year and the balance of the rebate must be paid within 120 days of the receipt of the application. 4. The program must permit the eligible charity to make an application for a rebate for a taxation year based on an estimate of the taxes or amounts on account of taxes payable by the eligible charity on the property it occupies. 5. The program must provide for final adjustments, to be made after the taxes or amounts on account of taxes paid by the charity can be determined, in respect of differences between the estimated rebate paid by the City and the rebate to which the charity is entitled. 6. The program must require, as a condition of receiving a rebate for a year, that a charity repay any other municipality amounts by which the rebates the charity received for the year from that other municipality exceed the rebates from that other municipality to which the charity is entitled for the year. 7. An application for a taxation year must be made after January 1 of the year and no later than the last day of February of the following year.  However, the City may accept applications after that deadline if, in the opinion of the City, extenuating circumstances justify the applicant being unable to make the application by the deadline.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (3); 2009, c. 33, Sched. 21, s. 4 (22). Program options (4) The following apply with respect to what a tax rebate program under this section may provide but is not required to provide: 1.

Procedural requirements (5) The program may include procedural requirements that must be satisfied for an eligible charity to be entitled to a rebate required under subsection (3).  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (5). Sharing amounts of rebates (6) The amount of a rebate paid under this section on a property shall be shared by the City and school boards that share in the revenue from the taxes on the property in the same proportion as the City and school boards share in those revenues.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (6). Statement of costs shared by school boards (7) If the City gives a rebate to a charity or similar organization, the City shall also give the charity or similar organization a written statement of the proportion of the costs of the rebate that is shared by school boards.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (7). Interest (8) The City shall pay interest, at the same rate of interest that applies under subsection 257.11 (4) of the Education Act, on the amount of any rebate to which the eligible charity is entitled under this section if the City fails to rebate or credit the amount within the time specified in paragraph 3 of subsection (3) or within such other time as the Minister of Finance may prescribe.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (8). No fee (9) Despite this Act, no fee may be charged by the City to process an application under this section.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (9).

A rebate under subsection (3) with respect to the year shall be redetermined using the new taxes on property for the year based on the new assessment. 2. If, as a result of a redetermination under paragraph 1, the amount of the rebate is increased, the increased amount shall be paid to the eligible charity in accordance with this section. 3. If, as a result of a redetermination under paragraph 1, the amount of the rebate is decreased and amounts paid on account of the rebate exceed the redetermined amount of the rebate, the excess payments are a debt due to the City, but the City shall not take any action to collect the debt, including the imposition of interest, until 120 days after providing the eligible charity with notice of the debt.  2006, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 329 (10); 2008, c. 7, Sched. C, s. 6; 2017, c. 10, Sched. 2, s. 44.

            "content": "453.1 (1) In this section, âsocial housing programâ means a program or project that, (a) is entirely owned or operated by or is leased to and operated by a non-profit housing co-operative as defined in the Co-operative Corporations Act or a non-profit corporation as defined in the National Housing Act (Canada) and that, in the opinion of the City, is designed to provide housing accommodation primarily for persons with low to moderate incomes, at a charge not exceeding the greater of, (i) the amount required to finance, operate and maintain such accommodation without profit, and (ii) the amount required to be charged for such accommodation under the terms of an agreement respecting the financing of the accommodation where one party is the provincial or federal government or an agent of either, or (b) provides housing accommodation that is owned and operated by or on behalf of Toronto Housing Company Inc. or Toronto Community Housing Corporation. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Zoning densities (2) Without limiting section 113, in a by-law passed under section 34 of the Planning Act, the City may, in addition to establishing densities under the authority of that section, establish one or more residential densities of development applicable to any land in respect of which the owner of the land and the operator of the housing accommodation, if different from the owner, agree with the City to provide all or such proportion as specified in the by-law of the housing accommodation located or to be located on the land, for the purpose of a social housing program. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Agreements (3) The City may require an owner and an operator, if different from the owner, to enter into one or more agreements respecting the provision of social housing accommodation referred to in subsection (2). 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Registration of agreement (4) An agreement under subsection (3) may be registered against the land to which it applies and the City may enforce its provisions against the owner and, subject to the Registry Act\r\nand the Land Titles Act, any and all subsequent owners of the land. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Validity of agreement (5) An agreement made under subsection (3) is not invalid by reason only of the failure to specify particulars of a social housing program. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Consent required (6) If an agreement has been registered under subsection (4), no person shall, during the term of the agreement in respect of any unit of housing accommodation that is part of a social housing program, without the written consent of the City, (a) convey the unit, by way of deed or transfer, or grant, assign or exercise a power of appointment with respect to the unit; (b) mortgage or charge the unit or enter into an agreement of purchase and sale respecting the unit; or (c) enter into an agreement that has the effect of granting the use of or right in the unit directly or by entitlement to renewal for a period of 21 years or more. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Effect of lack of consent (7) If an agreement has been registered under subsection (4), an agreement, conveyance, mortgage or charge made, or a power of appointment granted, assigned or exercised in contravention of subsection (6), does not create or convey any interest in the unit. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Restriction (8) If notice of an agreement has been registered against land to which the Land Titles Act applies under subsection (4), the City shall apply to the land registrar to have an entry made on the register that, unless the City has given its consent, (a) no transfer shall be made or charge created; (b) no notice of agreement of sale and purchase shall be registered; and (c) no lease or notice of lease having the effect of granting the use of or right in land directly or by entitlement to renewal for a period of 21 years or more shall be registered. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Certificate of clerk (9) If a written consent under subsection (6) has been given by the City, the city clerk shall provide a certificate, in registrable form, to the person obtaining the consent stating that the written consent of the City has been obtained and the certificate is conclusive evidence that the consent was given and that the provisions of this section leading to the consent have been complied with and, after the certificate has been given, no action may be maintained to question the validity of the consent and the certificate may be registered in the proper land registry office. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Validity of by-laws restricting occupancy (10) A by-law passed by the City that implements subsection (2) is not invalid by reason only that the effect of it is to restrict occupancy of housing accommodation to such persons or classes of persons as are set out in the by-law. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Offence (11) A by-law that implements subsection (2) may provide that any person entering into an agreement under subsection (3) who fails to provide the proportion or number of units for such period of time as may be specified in the agreement for the purposes of a social housing program is guilty of an offence and upon conviction is liable to a fine of not more than $10,000. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Damages (12) In addition to the penalty set out in subsection (11), every owner who contravenes the agreement is liable for damages payable to the City in an amount equal to the difference between the charge that should have been made for the housing accommodation under the agreement and the actual charge made for the housing accommodation for the period of time that the owner or operator has contravened the agreement and the damages may be recovered as a debt due to the City. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Contents of agreement (13) Subsections (6), (7) and (8) do not apply to an agreement unless those subsections are set out in the agreement. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Exemptions or reductions (14) In a by-law passed under section 34 of the Planning Act that implements subsection (2), the City may give exemptions or reductions, or both, from the zoning provisions and standards otherwise applicable to similar forms of housing accommodation that are not part of a social housing program. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. No appeal (15) Despite subsection 34 (11) of the Planning Act, a person may not appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal in respect of all or any part of a requested amendment to a City by-law passed under section 34 of that Act if the amendment or part of the amendment proposes to establish one or more residential densities of development authorized by subsection (2). 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95; 2017, c. 23, Sched. 5, s. 19; 2021, c. 4, Sched. 6, s. 37 (1). Agreement with owner (16) The City may enter into an agreement with the owner of land proposing a development on the land that is to contain housing accommodation for the purposes of a social housing program but for which no by-law under section 34 of the Planning Act prescribing the matters set out in subsection (2) is required and the agreement may contain provisions respecting the maintenance of the accommodation and such other terms as are agreed between the owner and the City and subsections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (13) apply to the agreement. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Same, existing housing (16.1) The City may, regardless of whether a by-law under section 34 of the Planning Act prescribing the matters set out in subsection (2) is in effect, enter into an agreement with the owner of land that contains housing accommodation to be used for the purposes of a social housing program, and the agreement may contain provisions respecting the maintenance of the accommodation and such other terms as are agreed between the owner and the City and subsections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (13) apply to the agreement. 2017, c. 10, Sched. 2, s. 68. Old references (17) A reference in a by-law passed by the City before May 24, 1988 to âassisted housingâ, âassisted housing programâ or an âowner of land who has entered an agreement under section 5 of The City of Toronto Act, 1975 (No. 2)â is deemed to be a reference to âsocial housingâ, âsocial housing programâ and an âowner of land and operator of the housing accommodation if different from the ownerâ, respectively. 2006, c. 32, Sched. B, s. 95. Continuation of by-laws, agreements (18) A by-law referred to in subsection 5 (2) of\r\nThe City of Toronto Act, 1975 (No. 2), being chapter 117, and any agreement entered into under subsection 5 (3) of that Act before May 24, 1988, continues in force until repealed or revoked by the City. 2006, c. 32, Sched.
