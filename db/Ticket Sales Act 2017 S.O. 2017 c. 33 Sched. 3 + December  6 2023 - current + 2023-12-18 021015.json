Absolute liability (5) An order made under subsection (1) imposing an administrative penalty against a ticket business applies even if, (a) the ticket business took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention on which the order is based; or (b) at the time of the contravention, the ticket business had an honest and reasonable belief in a mistaken set of facts that, if true, would have rendered the contravention innocent. No effect on offences (6) For greater certainty, nothing in subsection (5) affects the prosecution of an offence. Other measures (7) Subject to section 33, an administrative penalty may be imposed alone or in conjunction with the exercise of any measure against a ticket business provided by this Act or the regulations.
