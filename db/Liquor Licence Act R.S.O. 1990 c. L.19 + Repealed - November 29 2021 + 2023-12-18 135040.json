Seizure (1) A police officer may seize any thing, including liquor, if, (a) he or she reasonably believes that the thing will afford evidence of an offence under this Act; (b) he or she reasonably believes that, (i) the thing was used or is being used in connection with the commission of an offence under this Act, and (ii) unless the thing is seized it is likely that it would continue to be used or would be used again in the commission of an offence under this Act; or (c) he or she reasonably believes that the thing is proceeds from the commission of an offence under this Act.  1994, c. 37, s. 18 (1). Same (1.1) If an offence appears to have been committed under this Act and a police officer reasonably believes, in view of the offence apparently committed and the presence of liquor, that a further offence is likely to be committed, the police officer may seize the liquor and the packages in which it is kept.  1994, c. 37, s. 18 (1). Order of restoration (2) The Ontario Court of Justice may, upon the application of any person made within thirty days of a seizure under subsection (1) or (1.1), order that the things seized be restored forthwith to the applicant if the court is satisfied that, (a) the applicant is entitled to possession of the things seized; (b) the things seized are not required as evidence in any proceeding; (c) continued detention of the things seized is not necessary to prevent the commission of an offence; and (d) it is unlikely that the things will be forfeited on conviction under subsection (5).

An order directing that the thing or any part of the thing be returned to the applicant. 2. An order directing that any interest in the thing be vested in the applicant. 3.
