(4) A material discrepancy exists if the individual or aggregate effect of one or more errors, omissions or misstatements identified in the course of verification makes it probable that there is a discrepancy of 5 per cent or more in the amount reported under subparagraph 9 i of subsection 21 (1) for an initiative report, or in the amount reported under subparagraph 10 i of subsection 21 (1) for a reversal report. (5) If the accredited verification body prepared a positive verification statement under subsection (2), it shall submit the statement to the sponsor and shall ensure that the verification statement also meets the requirements of clause 4.9 of ISO 14064-3.",
