In these Rules, “actual alcoholic strength by volume” means the number of volumes of pure alcohol contained at a temperature of 20°C in 100 volumes of wine at that temperature; (“titre alcoométrique volumique réel”) “alcohol” means ethyl alcohol; (“éthanol”) “approved” means approved by Vintners Quality Alliance Ontario (VQA Ontario) pursuant to the rules it makes under clause 5 (1) (d) of the Act; (“approuvé”) “brix” means the quantity of dissolved solids expressed as grams of sucrose in 100 grams of grape juice or grape must at 20°C; (“degré Brix”) “carbonic maceration” means a winemaking process in which whole grapes are placed for a few days in a closed tank whose atmosphere is comprised of carbon dioxide resulting either from an external source or from the respiration of the grapes and the fermentation of a part of the crushed grapes, or both; (“macération carbonique”) “chaptalization” means enrichment by the addition of sugar to fresh grapes, grape juice or grape must, prior to or during fermentation; (“chaptalisation”) “concentration” means any method by which grape juice or wine is concentrated and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes mechanical or chemical processes, heating, cooling or evaporation, and “concentrate” has a corresponding meaning; (“concentration”, “concentrer”) “container” means a receptacle, package, wrapper or confining band in which a wine is offered for sale; (“récipient”) “controlled by”, when referring to property of a bottling manufacturer, means property on which the manufacturer has the legal right to perform, and does perform, all of the acts common to viticulture under the terms of a lease, rental or similar agreement; (“contrôlé par”) “cuvée” means grape must in fermentation or wine, or a mixture of grape musts in fermentation and wines, intended for the preparation of sparkling wine, having a total alcoholic strength of not less than 9 per cent by volume; (“cuvée de tirage”) “domicile” means the principal place of business where a wine is produced and prepared for commercial packaging; (“domicile”) “dosage” means the product added to sparkling wine to enhance specific flavour qualities or to maximize fill levels after dégorgement, or both; (“dosage”) “fermentation” means the natural bio-chemical process by which yeast converts sugar to ethyl alcohol and other by-products; (“fermentation”) “finish” means to carry out the treatments required to prepare a wine for packaging; (“finir”) “fortify” means to add alcohol, brandy or fruit spirit to a wine; (“fortifier”) “geographical indication” means an indication on the label or container of wine, other than the domicile of the manufacturer, that identifies a wine as originating from the Province of Ontario or a viticultural area listed in Table 1; (“indication géographique”) “grape concentrate” means uncaramelized grape juice obtained by the partial dehydration of grape juice carried out by a recognized method in such a way that the figure indicated by a refractometer at a temperature of 20°C is not less than 45° brix and the actual alcohol is not more than 0.5 per cent by volume;
