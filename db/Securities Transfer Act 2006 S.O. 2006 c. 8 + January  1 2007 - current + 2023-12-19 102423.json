When notice is effective for a transaction (4) Notice, knowledge or a notice received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time when it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction and, in any event, from the time when it would have been brought to the attention of that individual if the organization had exercised due diligence. 2006, c. 8, s. 3 (4). Same (5) For the purpose of subsection (4), an organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the individual conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with those routines. 2006, c. 8, s. 3 (5). Same (6) For the purpose of subsection (4), due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless, (a) that communication is part of the individual’s regular duties; or (b) the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information. 2006, c. 8, s. 3 (6).",
