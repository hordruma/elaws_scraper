Raising of money by area municipality (5) The area municipality may pay the amount chargeable to it under this section out of its general funds or may pass by-laws under section 221 of the Municipal Act for imposing water rates to recover the whole or part of the amount chargeable to the area municipality in the same manner as if the waterworks system had been constructed, extended or improved by the area municipality although in the by-law authorizing the waterworks system there was no provision for imposing, with the approval of the Municipal Board, upon owners or occupants of land who derive or will or may derive a benefit from the waterworks system a water rate sufficient to pay for the whole or a portion or percentage of the capital cost of the waterworks system.

Extension of time (4) Despite subsection (1), a by-law for assuming any specific work or trunk distribution main may, with the approval of the Municipal Board, be passed on or after the day of establishment and in that case the by-law becomes effective on the date provided therein. Regional liability (5) Where the Regional Corporation assumes a work or trunk distribution main vested in an area municipality or local board, (a) no compensation or damages shall be payable to the area municipality or local board; (b) the Regional Corporation shall thereafter pay to the area municipality before the due date all amounts of principal and interest becoming due upon any outstanding debt of the area municipality in respect of such work or main, but nothing in this clause requires the Regional Corporation to pay that portion of the amounts of principal and interest that under the Local Improvement Act is payable as the owners’ share of a local improvement work. Default (6) If the Regional Corporation fails to make any payment on or before the due date required by clause (5) (b), the area municipality may charge the Regional Corporation interest at the rate of 15 per cent per year, or such lower rate as the council of the area municipality determines, from such date until payment is made.
