Exception (6) Despite clauses (5) (a) and (b), the principal and interest that must be paid in a year under those clauses does not include any outstanding amount of principal specified as payable on the maturity date of a debt instrument to the extent that one or more refinancing debt instruments are issued by the board to repay the outstanding principal.  2009, c. 25, s. 30 (8). All debt instruments rank equally (7) Despite any other provision of this or any other Act or any differences in date of issue or maturity, every debt instrument prescribed under clause (3) (f) issued by a board shall rank concurrently and equally in respect of payment of principal and interest with all other debt instruments issued by the board, except as to the availability of any sinking fund, retirement fund or other fund prescribed under clause (3) (e) applicable to any issue of debt instruments.  2009, c. 25, s. 30 (8).

Certain rights and duties continued (9) Subject to subsection (10), the rights and duties of, (a) a treasurer or a clerk-treasurer of a county or municipality; (b) a treasurer of an old board; (c) the council of a municipality; (d) a school authority; or (e) an old board, under subsections 234 (3) to (6) of this Act, as those provisions read immediately before subsection 113 (1) of the Education Quality Improvement Act, 1997 came into force, continue with respect to debentures to which those subsections applied.  1997, c. 31, s. 113 (1).
