Determination of jurisdiction (3) For the purposes of this section, (a)  the location of the debtor is determined by subsection 7 (3); (b)  the issuer’s jurisdiction is determined under section 44 of the Securities Transfer Act, 2006; (c)  the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction is determined under section 45 of the Securities Transfer Act, 2006.  2006, c. 8, s. 126. Same (4) For the purposes of this section, the following rules determine a futures intermediary’s jurisdiction: 1.  If an agreement between the futures intermediary and futures customer governing the futures account expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the futures intermediary’s jurisdiction for purposes of the law of that jurisdiction, this Act or any provision of this Act, the jurisdiction expressly provided for in the agreement is the futures intermediary’s jurisdiction. 2.  If paragraph 1 does not apply and an agreement between the futures intermediary and futures customer governing the futures account expressly provides that the agreement shall be governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the futures intermediary’s jurisdiction. 3.  If neither paragraph 1 nor 2 applies and an agreement between the futures intermediary and futures customer governing the futures account expressly provides that the futures account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the futures intermediary’s jurisdiction. 4.  If none of the preceding paragraphs applies, the futures intermediary’s jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the futures customer’s account is located. 5.  If none of the preceding paragraphs applies, the futures intermediary’s jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the chief executive office of the futures intermediary is located.  2006, c. 8, s. 126. Matters governed by law of debtor’s jurisdiction (5) The law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located governs, (a)  perfection of a security interest in investment property by registration; (b)  perfection of a security interest in investment property granted by a broker or securities intermediary where the secured party relies on attachment of the security interest as perfection; and (c)  perfection of a security interest in a futures contract or futures account granted by a futures intermediary where the secured party relies on attachment of the security interest as perfection.  2006, c. 8, s. 126. Change of jurisdiction (6) If a security interest to which subsection (5) applies is a perfected security interest under the law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located, and if the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located changes as a result of a change in a factor by which the location of the debtor is determined under subsection 7 (3), the security interest continues perfected only until the earliest of, (a)  60 days after the day the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located changed; (b)  15 days after the day the secured party learns that the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located has changed; and (c)  the day perfection ceases under the previously applicable law. 2017, c. 20, Sched. 9, s. 9. Application of subs. (6) (6.1) For greater certainty, if a change in the jurisdiction where the debtor is located occurs on December 31, 2015 and the change is solely a result of the operation of subsections 7 (3), (4) and (5) of this Act, as they read on that day, and not a result of a change in a factor by which the location of the debtor is determined, subsection 7.3 (6) applies to the change instead of subsection (6) of this section. 2017, c. 20, Sched. 9, s. 9. Same (7) If a security interest to which clause (2) (b), (c) or (d) applies is a perfected security interest under the law of the jurisdiction of the issuer, securities intermediary or futures intermediary, as applicable, and if there is a change in the jurisdiction of the issuer, securities intermediary or futures intermediary, as determined under clause (3) (b) or (c) or subsection (4), the security interest continues perfected only until the earliest of, (a)  60 days after the day the jurisdiction of the issuer, securities intermediary or futures intermediary, as applicable, changed; (b)  15 days after the day the secured party learns that the jurisdiction of the issuer, securities intermediary or futures intermediary, as applicable, has changed; and (c)  the day perfection ceases under the previously applicable law. 2017, c. 20, Sched. 9, s. 9.

Note: Despite the re-enactment of subsections 44 (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13) and (14) by the Statutes of Ontario, 1998, chapter 18, Schedule E, subsection 196 (1), those subsections, as they read immediately before December 18, 1998, continue to apply with respect to decisions or offers of settlement that the registrar has made before December 18, 1998.  See: 1998, c. 18, Sched. E, s. 196 (2). Payment (15) When an offer of settlement has been accepted or the time for an application under subsection (13) or (14) has expired or, where an application has been made, it is disposed of and it is finally determined that the claimant is entitled to payment of compensation out of the Assurance Fund, the registrar shall certify to the Treasurer of Ontario the sum found to be payable, including any costs awarded to the claimant, and the Treasurer shall pay the sum to the claimant out of the Assurance Fund.  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10, s. 44 (15). Subrogation (16) Where compensation is paid to a claimant under this section, the registrar is subrogated to the rights of the claimant to the amount so paid against any person indebted to the claimant and whose debt to the claimant was the basis of the loss or damage in respect of which the claimant was paid, and the registrar may enforce those rights by action in court or otherwise in the name of Her Majesty in right of Ontario.  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10, s. 44 (16). Action by claimant (17) The registrar may require a claimant to exhaust the claimant’s remedies against the collateral, the debtor and any guarantor and, where the registrar does so, the Assurance Fund is liable for the reasonable costs of the claimant, including solicitor and client costs.  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10, s. 44 (17). Protection from liability (18) No action or other proceeding for damages shall be instituted against the Crown with respect to any matter in relation to which a claim against the Assurance Fund has been filed.  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10, s. 44 (18). Idem (19) No claim shall be filed against the Assurance Fund with respect to any matter in relation to which an action or other proceeding for damages has been commenced in any court against the Crown.  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10, s. 44 (19). Maximum payable from Assurance Fund (20) The maximum amount that may be paid out of the Assurance Fund with respect to claims related to any one security agreement shall not exceed $1,000,000 in total.  R.S.O.  1990, c. P.10, s. 44 (20). Idem (21) If the total of all claims against the Assurance Fund in respect of a security agreement exceeds $1,000,000, payments to claimants shall be made in accordance with the ratio that the amount of the claimant’s loss bears to the total amount of the losses of all claimants.
