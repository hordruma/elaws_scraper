The total assessment of the properties in a property class for the previous year includes all assessments made for the purposes of taxation for the previous year that are made after the return of the roll for the previous year. 2.

(5) Subject to sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.6, the transition ratio for a property class for the purposes of subsection 275 (8) of the Act is determined as follows: 1.  Multiply the unadjusted tax ratio for the property class for the taxation year by the amount of the total assessment of the properties in that property class for the year. 2.  Multiply the unadjusted tax ratio for the property class for the taxation year by the amount of the total assessment of the properties in that property class for the previous year. 3.  Determine the weighted reassessment change for the specified residential classes by dividing “A” by “B” where, “A”  is the sum of all amounts each of which is an amount determined under paragraph 1 for a property class included in the specified residential classes, and “B”  is the sum of all amounts each of which is an amount determined under paragraph 2 for a property class included in the specified residential classes. 4.

Determine the weighted reassessment change for the industrial classes by dividing “E” by “F” where, “E”  is the sum of all amounts each of which is an amount determined under paragraph 1 for a property class included in the industrial classes, and “F”  is the sum of all amounts each of which is an amount determined under paragraph 2 for a property class included in the industrial classes. 6.  For each property class that is not included in the specified residential classes, the commercial classes or the industrial classes, determine the weighted reassessment change for the property class by dividing the amount determined under paragraph 1 for the property class by the amount determined under paragraph 2 for the property class. 7.  Determine the adjustment factor for each property class by dividing “G” by “H” where, “G”  is, (a)  the weighted reassessment change for the commercial classes as determined under paragraph 4 if the property class is included in the commercial classes, (b)  the weighted reassessment change for the industrial classes as determined under paragraph 5 if the property class is included in the industrial classes, or (c)  the weighted reassessment change for the property class as determined under paragraph 6 if the property class is not included in the specified residential classes, the commercial classes or the industrial classes, and “H”  is the weighted reassessment change for the specified residential classes as determined under paragraph 3. 8.

Add the amount determined in paragraph 1 to the capped taxes for the taxation year. 3.  Subtract the amount determined under paragraph 1 of subsection 291 (1) of the Act from the lesser of the amount determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection and the uncapped taxes for the property for the taxation year. 4.

For every general or special municipal levy for the previous year that applied to property in the City, determine the previous year’s levy amount under subsection (2). 2.  Despite paragraph 1, only general or special levies that applied in the previous year to at least 50 per cent of the sum of the assessments for the taxation year for property in the property class in the City are included for the purposes of this subsection. 3.  Determine the total weighted assessment for the City by adding the weighted assessment for the taxation year, as determined under subsection (5), for each property class to which the levy applied. 4.  For each levy, determine the residential rate to raise the previous year’s levy by dividing the previous year’s levy amount, referred to in paragraph 1, by the total weighted assessment determined under paragraph 3. 5.  For each levy, determine a class rate to raise the previous year’s levy for each property class for the taxation year by multiplying the residential rate to raise the previous year’s levy, as determined under paragraph 4, by the tax ratio for the property class for the taxation year. 6.

Apply the tax rate for the previous year for each property class to the total assessment for property in the property class to which the levy applied, as determined under subsection (3). 2.  The previous year’s levy amount is the sum of the amounts determined under paragraph 1 for the property classes.  O. Reg. 121/07, s. 19 (2).

O. Reg. 121/07, s. 19 (3). (4) Subject to subsection (4.1), the City may pass a by-law in a year opting to have subsections (4.2) to (4.4) apply for the year. O. Reg. 63/17, s. 6 (2).

Reg. 63/17, s. 6 (2). (4.2) If the City has passed a by-law under subsection (4), the City shall adjust the total assessment for property in a property class in the City, as determined under subsection (3), so that the total assessment for property in a property class in the City excludes changes to the tax roll for the previous year resulting from one or more of the following events, except as provided by subsection (4.3): 1.  A correction under subsection 32 (1.1) of the Assessment Act. 2.  An assessment under subsection 32 (4) of the Assessment Act. 3.  A reconsideration under section 39.1 of the Assessment Act. 4.  An appeal under section 40 of the Assessment Act. 5.  An application under section 46 of the Assessment Act. O. Reg. 63/17, s. 6 (2). (4.3) Subject to subsection (4.4), if an event listed in paragraphs 3 to 5 of subsection (4.2) changes the assessed value of a property because of one of the following types of changes, the change to the assessed value of the property shall, despite subsection (4.2), be included in the total assessment for property in the property class: 1.  A change with respect to which an additional assessment of land is made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act. 2.  A change to the state or condition of land that results in the assessment made under section 36 of the Assessment Act for the taxation year differing from the assessment for the previous taxation year. 3.  A change in the classification of land, except under section 30, 34 or 38 of Ontario Regulation 282/98 (General) under the Assessment Act. 4.  A change in the status of land from taxable to tax-exempt or vice-versa. 5.  A change in the valuation approach with respect to whether land is eligible for assessment under section 19.0.1 of the Assessment Act. O. Reg. 63/17, s. 6 (2). (4.4) A change to the assessed value of a property referred to in subsection (4.3) shall be excluded from the total assessment for property in the property class if the current value of the property for the taxation year immediately preceding the first year to which the most recent general reassessment applied is also changed under section 39.1, 40 or 46 of the Assessment Act.
