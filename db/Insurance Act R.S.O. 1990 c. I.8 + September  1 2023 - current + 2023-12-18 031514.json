Definition (2) In this section, âpolicyâ does not include interim receipts or binders. STATUTORY CONDITIONS Misrepresentation 1. If a person applying for insurance falsely describes the property to the prejudice of the insurer, or misrepresents or fraudulently omits to communicate any circumstance that is material to be made known to the insurer in order to enable it to judge of the risk to be undertaken, the contract is void as to any property in relation to which the misrepresentation or omission is material. Property of Others 2. Unless otherwise specifically stated in the contract, the insurer is not liable for loss or damage to property owned by any person other than the insured, unless the interest of the insured therein is stated in the contract. Change of Interest 3. The insurer is liable for loss or damage occurring after an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) or change of title by succession, by operation of law, or by death. Material Change 4. Any change material to the risk and within the control and knowledge of the insured avoids the contract as to the part affected thereby, unless the change is promptly notified in writing to the insurer or its local agent, and the insurer when so notified may return the unearned portion, if any, of the premium paid and cancel the contract, or may notify the insured in writing that, if the insured desires the contract to continue in force, the insured must, within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice, pay to the insurer an additional premium, and in default of such payment the contract is no longer in force and the insurer shall return the unearned portion, if any, of the premium paid. Termination 5. (1) This contract may be terminated, (a)  by the insurer giving to the insured fifteen days notice of termination by registered mail or five days written notice of termination personally delivered or delivered by prepaid courier if there is a record by the person who delivered it that the notice has been sent; (b)  by the insured at any time on request. (2) Where this contract is terminated by the insurer, (a)  the insurer shall refund the excess of premium actually paid by the insured over the proportionate premium for the expired time, but, in no event, shall the proportionate premium for the expired time be deemed to be less than any minimum retained premium specified; and (b)  the refund shall accompany the notice unless the premium is subject to adjustment or determination as to amount, in which case the refund shall be made as soon as practicable. (3) Where this contract is terminated by the insured, the insurer shall refund as soon as practicable the excess of premium actually paid by the insured over the short rate premium for the expired time, but in no event shall the short rate premium for the expired time be deemed to be less than any minimum retained premium specified. (4) The refund may be made by money, postal or express company money order or cheque payable at par. (5) The fifteen days mentioned in clause (1) (a) of this condition commences to run on the day following the receipt of the registered letter at the post office to which it is addressed. The five days mentioned in clause (1) (a) of this condition commences to run on the day following the day there is a record by the person who delivered it that the notice has been sent. Requirements After Loss 6. (1) Upon the occurrence of any loss of or damage to the insured property, the insured shall, if the loss or damage is covered by the contract, in addition to observing the requirements of conditions 9, 10 and 11, (a)  forthwith give notice thereof in writing to the insurer; (b)  deliver as soon as practicable to the insurer a proof of loss verified by a statutory declaration, (i)  giving a complete inventory of the destroyed and damaged property and showing in detail quantities, costs, actual cash value and particulars of amount of loss claimed, (ii)  stating when and how the loss occurred, and if caused by fire or explosion due to ignition, how the fire or explosion originated, so far as the insured knows or believes, (iii)  stating that the loss did not occur through any wilful act or neglect or the procurement, means or connivance of the insured, (iv)  showing the amount of other insurances and the names of other insurers, (v)  showing the interest of the insured and of all others in the property with particulars of all liens, encumbrances and other charges upon the property, (vi)  showing any changes in title, use, occupation, location, possession or exposures of the property since the issue of the contract, (vii)  showing the place where the property insured was at the time of loss; (c)  if required, give a complete inventory of undamaged property and showing in detail quantities, cost, actual cash value; (d)  if required and if practicable, produce books of account, warehouse receipts and stock lists, and furnish invoices and other vouchers verified by statutory declaration, and furnish a copy of the written portion of any other contract. (2) The evidence furnished under clauses (1) (c) and (d) of this condition shall not be considered proofs of loss within the meaning of conditions 12 and 13. Fraud 7. Any fraud or wilfully false statement in a statutory declaration in relation to any of the above particulars, vitiates the claim of the person making the declaration. Who may give notice and proof 8. Notice of loss may be given and proof of loss may be made by the agent of the insured named in the contract in case of absence or inability of the insured to give the notice or make the proof, and absence or inability being satisfactorily accounted for, or in the like case, or if the insured refuses to do so, by a person to whom any part of the insurance money is payable. Salvage 9. (1) The insured, in the event of any loss or damage to any property insured under the contract, shall take all reasonable steps to prevent further damage to such property so damaged and to prevent damage to other property insured hereunder including, if necessary, its removal to prevent damage or further damage thereto. (2) The insurer shall contribute proportionately towards any reasonable and proper expenses in connection with steps taken by the insured and required under subcondition (1) of this condition according to the respective interests of the parties. Entry, Control, Abandonment 10. After loss or damage to insured property, the insurer has an immediate right of access and entry by accredited agents sufficient to enable them to survey and examine the property, and to make an estimate of the loss or damage, and, after the insured has secured the property, a further right of access and entry sufficient to enable them to make appraisement or particular estimate of the loss or damage, but the insurer is not entitled to the control or possession of the insured property, and without the consent of the insurer there can be no abandonment to it of insured property. Appraisal 11. In the event of disagreement as to the value of the property insured, the property saved or the amount of the loss, those questions shall be determined by appraisal as provided under the Insurance Act before there can be any recovery under this contract whether the right to recover on the contract is disputed or not, and independently of all other questions. There shall be no right to an appraisal until a specific demand therefor is made in writing and until after proof of loss has been delivered. When Loss Payable 12. The loss is payable within sixty days after completion of the proof of loss, unless the contract provides for a shorter period. Replacement 13. (1) The insurer, instead of making payment, may repair, rebuild, or replace the property damaged or lost, giving written notice of its intention so to do within thirty days after receipt of the proofs of loss. (2) In that event the insurer shall commence to so repair, rebuild, or replace the property within forty-five days after receipt of the proofs of loss, and shall thereafter proceed with all due diligence to the completion thereof. Action 14. Every action or proceeding against the insurer for the recovery of a claim under or by virtue of this contract is absolutely barred unless commenced within one year next after the loss or damage occurs. Notice 15. (1) Written notice may be given to the insurer in the following ways: 1.  It may be personally delivered at the chief agency or head office of the insurer in the Province. 2.  It may be sent by registered mail to the chief agency or head office of the insurer in the Province. 3.  It may be delivered by electronic means. (2) Written notice may be given to the insured named in the contract in the following ways: 1.  It may be personally delivered. 2.  It may be delivered by prepaid courier to the latest address of the insured on the records of the insurer if there is a record by the person who has delivered it that the notice has been sent. 3.  It may be sent by registered mail to the latest address of the insured on the records of the insurer. 4.  It may be delivered by electronic means if the insured consents to delivery by electronic means. (3) In this condition, the expression âregisteredâ means registered in or outside Canada.

Exception, public transit vehicles (1.1) Despite subsection (1) and the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, no statutory accident benefits are payable in respect of an occupant of a public transit vehicle, in respect of an incident that occurs on or after the date this subsection comes into force, if the public transit vehicle did not collide with another automobile or any other object in the incident. 2011, c. 9, Sched. 21, s. 4.

In respect of an occupant of an automobile, i.  the occupant has recourse against the insurer of an automobile in respect of which the occupant is an insured, ii.  if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, the occupant has recourse against the insurer of the automobile in which he or she was an occupant, iii.  if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i or ii, the occupant has recourse against the insurer of any other automobile involved in the incident from which the entitlement to statutory accident benefits arose, iv.  if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, ii or iii, the occupant has recourse against the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund. 2.  In respect of non-occupants, i.  the non-occupant has recourse against the insurer of an automobile in respect of which the non-occupant is an insured, ii.  if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, the non-occupant has recourse against the insurer of the automobile that struck the non-occupant, iii.  if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i or ii, the non-occupant has recourse against the insurer of any automobile involved in the incident from which the entitlement to statutory accident benefits arose, iv.  if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, ii or iii, the non-occupant has recourse against the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund.

Choice of insurer (4) If, under subparagraph i or iii of paragraph 1 or subparagraph i or iii of paragraph 2 of subsection (2), a person has recourse against more than one insurer for the payment of statutory accident benefits, the person, in his or her absolute discretion, may decide the insurer from which he or she will claim the benefits. R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, s. 268 (4); 1993, c. 10, s. 1. Same (5) Despite subsection (4), if a person is a named insured under a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability policy or the person is the spouse or a dependant, as defined in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, of a named insured, the person shall claim statutory accident benefits against the insurer under that policy. 1993, c. 10, s. 26 (2); 1999, c. 6, s. 31 (9); 2005, c. 5, s. 35 (13).

Same (5.2) If there is more than one insurer against which a person may claim benefits under subsection (5) and the person was, at the time of the incident, an occupant of an automobile in respect of which the person is the named insured or the spouse or a dependant of the named insured, the person shall claim statutory accident benefits against the insurer of the automobile in which the person was an occupant. 1993, c. 10, s. 26 (2); 1999, c. 6, s. 31 (10); 2005, c. 5, s. 35 (14).

R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, s. 268 (6). Idem (7) The insurance mentioned in subsection (1) is excess insurance to any other insurance indemnifying the injured person or in respect of a deceased person for the expenses. R.S.O. 1990, c.

STATUTORY CONDITIONS The Contract 1. (1) The application, this policy, any document attached to this policy when issued, and any amendment to the contract agreed upon in writing after the policy is issued, constitute the entire contract, and no agent has authority to change the contract or waive any of its provisions. (2) Repealed: 2012, c. 8, Sched. 23, s. 42 (2). Copy of Application (3) The insurer shall, upon request, furnish to the insured or to a claimant under the contract a copy of the application. Material Facts 2. No statement made by the insured or person insured at the time of application for this contract shall be used in defence of a claim under or to avoid this contract unless it is contained in the application or any other written statements or answers furnished as evidence of insurability. Changes in Occupation 3. (1) If after the contract is issued the person insured engages for compensation in an occupation that is classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this contract, the liability under this contract is limited to the amount that the premium paid would have purchased for the more hazardous occupation according to the limits, classification of risks and premium rates in use by the insurer at the time the person insured engaged in the more hazardous occupation. (2) If the person insured changes his or her occupation from that stated in this contract to an occupation classified by the insurer as less hazardous and the insurer is so advised in writing, the insurer shall either, (a)  reduce the premium rate; or (b)  issue a policy for the unexpired term of this contract at the lower rate of premium applicable to the less hazardous occupation, according to the limits, classification of risks, and premium rates used by the insurer at the date of receipt of advice of the change in occupation, and shall refund to the insured the amount by which the unearned premium on this contract exceeds the premium at the lower rate for the unexpired term. Relation of Earnings to Insurance 4. (1) Where the benefits for loss of time payable hereunder, either alone or together with benefits for loss of time under another contract, exceed the money value of the time of the person insured, the insurer is liable only for that proportion of the benefits for loss of time stated in this policy that the money value of the time of the person insured bears to the aggregate of the benefits for loss of time payable under all such contracts and the excess premium, if any, paid by the insured shall be returned to the insured by the insurer. (2) The other contract referred to in subcondition (1) may include, (a)  a contract of group accident and sickness insurance; or (b)  a life insurance contract whereby the insurer undertakes to pay insurance money or to provide other benefits in the event that the person whose life is insured becomes disabled as a result of bodily injury or disease. Termination by Insured 5. The insured may at any time request that this contract be terminated and the insurer shall, as soon as practicable after the insured makes the request, refund the amount of premium actually paid by the insured that is in excess of the short rate premium calculated to the date of the request according to the table in use by the insurer at the time of the termination. Termination by Insurer 6. (1) The insurer may terminate this contract at any time by giving written notice of termination to the insured and by refunding concurrently with the giving of notice the amount of premium paid in excess of the proportional premium for the expired time. (2) The notice of termination may be given in the following ways: 1.  It may be personally delivered to the insured. 2.  It may be delivered by prepaid courier to the latest address of the insured on the records of the insurer if there is a record by the person who has delivered it that the notice has been sent. 3.  It may be sent by registered mail to the latest address of the insured on the records of the insurer. (3) Where the notice of termination is personally delivered or delivered by prepaid courier to the insured, five days notice of termination shall be given and, if delivered by prepaid courier, the five-day period begins on the day there is a record by the person who delivered it that the notice has been sent. Where it is mailed to the insured, 15 days notice of termination shall be given, and the 15-day period begins on the day the registered letter or notification of it is delivered to the insuredâs address.

(1) The insured or a person insured, or a beneficiary entitled to make a claim, or the agent of any of them, shall, (a)  give written notice of the claim to the insurer in one of the following ways, not later than 30 days from the date a claim arises under the contract on account of an accident, sickness or disability: (i)  by personal delivery or by sending it by registered mail to the head office or chief agency of the insurer in the Province, (ii)  by personal delivery to an authorized agent of the insurer in the Province, or (iii)  by delivery by electronic means; (b)  within ninety days from the date a claim arises under the contract on account of an accident, sickness or disability, furnish to the insurer such proof as is reasonably possible in the circumstances of the happening of the accident or the commencement of the sickness or disability, and the loss occasioned thereby, the right of the claimant to receive payment, his or her age, and the age of the beneficiary if relevant; and (c)  if so required by the insurer, furnish a satisfactory certificate as to the cause or nature of the accident, sickness or disability for which claim may be made under the contract and as to the duration of such sickness or disability. Failure to Give Notice or Proof (2) Failure to give notice of claim or furnish proof of claim within the time prescribed by this statutory condition does not invalidate the claim if, (a)  the notice or proof is given or furnished as soon as reasonably possible, and in no event later than one year from the date of the accident or the date a claim arises under the contract on account of sickness or disability if it is shown that it was not reasonably possible to give notice or furnish proof within the time so prescribed; or (b)  in the case of the death of the person insured, if a declaration of presumption of death is necessary, the notice or proof is given or furnished no later than one year after the date a court makes the declaration.

In any other case, i.  if the transaction is one that could reasonably be expected to occur in an open market, the terms and conditions of the transaction, including any applicable price, rent or interest rate, are comparable to the terms and conditions that can reasonably be expected to apply in a fair transaction between parties dealing at armâs length who are acting prudently, knowledgeably and willingly, or ii.  if the transaction is not one that can reasonably be expected to occur in an open market or between parties dealing at armâs length, the terms and conditions of the transaction, including any applicable price, rent or interest rate, can reasonably be expected to provide the insurer with fair value, having regard to all of the circumstances of the transaction, and are consistent with the parties to the transaction acting prudently, knowledgeably and willingly.  2006, c. 33, Sched.
