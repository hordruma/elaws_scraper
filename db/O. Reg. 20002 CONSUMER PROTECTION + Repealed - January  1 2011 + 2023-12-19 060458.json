The cancellation form must clearly indicate, in not less than 12 point type, i. that the consumer may use the form to cancel the contract or may cancel the contract in writing in any way, as long as it indicates the consumer’s intention to cancel the contract, ii. that the consumer may give notice of the cancellation at the postal address or the electronic mail address that must be included in the form, iii. that the consumer may reach the retailer of electricity or gas marketer by telephone at the toll-free telephone number that must be included in the form, iv. that, in the absence of its cancellation by the consumer, the retailer of electricity or gas marketer will renew or extend the contract without any changes, other than the changes described, in not less than 12 point type, on the form, to the terms of the contract and the price for the provision of electricity or gas. 3. The contract is renewed or extended for a period of no more than one year if the retailer of electricity or gas marketer complies with paragraphs 1 and 2 and the consumer does not give written notice of cancellation of the contract under subparagraph 1 vii. 4. Despite the renewal or extension of the contract under paragraph 3, a consumer may give written notice of cancellation of the contract within 35 days after the day on which the first bill under the renewed or extended contract is sent. 5.
