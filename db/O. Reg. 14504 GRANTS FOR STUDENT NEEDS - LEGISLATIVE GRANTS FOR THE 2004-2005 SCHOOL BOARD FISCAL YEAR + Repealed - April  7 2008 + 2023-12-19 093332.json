Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2004 Data Form A submitted to the Office of Collective Bargaining Information of the Ministry of Labour is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2004 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2004-2005 school year and October 31, 2004, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. 9.

For each cell in Table 6, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 6, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in that Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils. 5.

For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 6, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in that Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils. 5. Subtract one from the number obtained under paragraph 4. 6. Multiply the result obtained under paragraph 5 by $3,487. 7. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by the 2004-2005 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board. 8. Determine the special assistance amount, if any, for a high credit per pupil average, in accordance with subsection (14). 9. Add the amounts determined under paragraphs 7 and 8. 10.

If the number determined under paragraph 1 is more than 7.5, deduct 7.2 from 7.5. 4. Divide the number obtained under paragraph 2 or 3, as the case may be, by 7.2. 5. Multiply the number obtained under paragraph 4 by $3,258. 6. Multiply the amount obtained under paragraph 5 by the 2004-2005 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board. O. Reg. 145/04, s. 33 (14).",
