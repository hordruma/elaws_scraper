If the mutual fund trust has income earned in the taxation year outside Ontario and if the taxation year ends before January 1, 2000, the capital gains refund for the year is the amount calculated using the formula, F × R in which, “F” is its Ontario allocation factor for the year, and “R” is the amount that would have been its capital gains refund for the year if all of its income had been earned in the taxation year in Ontario. 3. If the mutual fund trust’s taxation year ends after December 31, 1999, the capital gains refund for the year is the lesser of, i. its Ontario refundable capital gains tax on hand at the end of the taxation year, and ii. the amount calculated using the formula, F × G × R in which, “F” is its Ontario allocation factor for the year, “G” is its capital gains redemptions for the year for the purposes of section 132 of the Federal Act, and “R” is the prescribed percentage of the highest tax rate for the taxation year or, if no percentage is prescribed, 75 per cent of the highest tax rate for the taxation year. 2000, c. 10, s. 13 (6); 2004, c. 16, s. 3.

R.S.O. 1990, c. I.2, s. 4 (9); 2004, c. 16, s. 3. Same (9.1) If a mutual fund trust’s refund for a taxation year under section 132 of the Federal Act is equal to the amount of its federal refundable capital gains tax on hand at the end of that year, the trust is entitled to receive an additional refund for the taxation year in the amount, if any, calculated using the formula, (A + B + C) – (D + E) in which, “A” is the total of all amounts each of which is an amount in respect of a prior taxation year ending after 1995 and before 2000 that is calculated under subsection (9.2), “B” is the total of all amounts each of which is the amount of the trust’s Ontario refundable capital gains tax on hand at the end of each taxation year ending after 1999, “C” is the total of all amounts, each of which is the amount that would be the trust’s surcharge under section 3 for a taxation year ending after 1995, if the amount of “A” or “B”, whichever applies for the year, were its gross tax amount determined under subsection 3 (2) for the year, “D” is the total of all amounts previously refunded to the trust under this subsection, and “E” is the total of all amounts refunded to the trust under subsections (8) and (9) in respect of taxation years ending after 1995. 2000, c. 10, s. 13 (7); 2004, c. 16, s. 3. Same (9.2) Each amount in respect of a prior taxation year that is to be included in “A” in subsection (9.1) is calculated using the formula, F × P × X in which, “F” is the trust’s Ontario allocation factor for the prior year, “P” is the percentage referred to in subsection (5) used in computing the tax payable under this section by the trust for the prior year, and “X” is the amount added to the trust’s federal refundable capital gains tax on hand at the end of the prior year. 2000, c. 10, s. 13 (7); 2004, c. 16, s. 3. Application of refund (10) Where a mutual fund trust is entitled to receive a refund under subsection (8) and is liable or is about to become liable to make any payment under this Act, the Minister may apply all or part of the amount that would otherwise be refunded under subsection (8), and under subsections (9) and (9.1) if applicable, to the liability and pay to the mutual fund trust the balance, if any, of the refund not so applied, and shall notify the mutual fund trust of the application of the amount of the refund not paid to the mutual fund trust.

(“bénéficiaire du transfert”)  1997, c. 43, Sched. B, s. 2 (1); 2004, c. 16, s. 3. Inter-provincial anti-avoidance (2) Despite any other provision of this Act except subsection (4), if a taxpayer disposes of property to a transferee, and clauses (3) (a) to (d) apply in respect of the disposition, the amount of the taxpayer’s deemed proceeds of disposition of the property is the total of, (a) the amount that is deemed to be the taxpayer’s proceeds of disposition of the property as determined under the Federal Act; and (b) the total of all amounts, each of which is in respect of a province in which the transferee has a permanent establishment, determined by multiplying, (i) the amount by which the cost amount of the property to the transferee under the laws of a province other than Ontario exceeds the amount referred to in clause (a), by, (ii) the percentage of the transferee’s taxable income, for the taxation year in which the transferee disposed of the property, (A) if the transferee is a corporation, that is deemed to be earned in that other province under regulations made under the Federal Act, or that would be deemed to be earned in that other province if the transferee had had taxable income for that year, or (B) if the transferee is a partnership, that the partnership would be deemed to have earned in that other province under regulations made under the Federal Act if the partnership were a corporation, its taxation year were its fiscal period, it had had income for the fiscal period and its taxable income for the year were its income for that fiscal period.  1997, c. 43, Sched. B, s. 2 (1); 2004, c. 16, s. 3. Application of subs.

Employment agencies (11.1) If an employer pays a fee to an employment agency in respect of a qualifying apprenticeship that is an eligible expenditure of the employer for a taxation year, (a) the employer is deemed to employ the apprentice for the purposes of the definition of “C” in the definition of “A” in subsection (3), and the employment agency is deemed not to employ the apprentice; and (b) the apprentice is deemed to serve the apprenticeship with the employer for the purposes of clause (10) (a), and not with the employment agency.  2005, c. 31, Sched. 11, s. 7 (3).
