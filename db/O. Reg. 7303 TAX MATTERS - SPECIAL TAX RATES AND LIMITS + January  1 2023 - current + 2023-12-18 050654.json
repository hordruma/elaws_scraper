(1) This section provides for the manner in which the tax rates on property in a property class are to be determined under subsections 311 (7) and 312 (7) of the Act if the conditions set out in those subsections are satisfied.  O. Reg. 73/03, s. 3 (1). (2) The tax rate for the general levy for the taxation year for the property class shall not exceed the sum of, (a)  the maximum class rate for the year determined for the property class under section 8; and (b)  the additional rate for the property class for the year that is determined under subsection (3) if, (i)  the municipality has calculated the tax rate for the property class pursuant to a regulation made under subsection 361 (11) of the Act, and (ii)  the property class is one of the commercial classes or industrial classes.  O. Reg. 73/03, s. 3 (2). (3) The additional rate for a property class for a taxation year for the purposes of clause (2) (b) is determined in the following manner: 1.  Determine the lowest rate that would raise an amount sufficient to fund rebates made under section 361 of the Act in respect of property in, i.  the commercial classes, if the property class is one of the commercial classes, or ii.  the industrial classes, if the property class is one of the industrial classes. 2.  If the property class is one of the commercial classes, allocate to the property class the rate that will result in the rates on all the commercial classes being in the same proportion to one another as the tax ratios established under section 308 of the Act for the commercial classes. 3.  If the property class is one of the industrial classes, allocate to the property class the rate that will result in the rates on all the industrial classes being in the same proportion to one another as the tax ratios established under section 308 of the Act for the industrial classes.  O. Reg. 73/03, s. 3 (3). (3.1) Despite clause (2) (a), a municipality may elect to apply a different tax rate for the general levy for the taxation year for the property class that does not exceed the rate determined using the formula: I ×{1 + 0.5 × [(G - H) / H]} in which, “G”  is the actual tax rate for the residential property class as calculated under section 11, excluding the tax rate for school purposes, “H”  is the notional tax rate for the residential property class as calculated under section 12, excluding the tax rate for school purposes, and “I”  is the notional tax rate, as calculated under section 12, for the property class to which subsection 311 (7) or 312 (7) of the Act applies, excluding the tax rate for school purposes.

For every general or special municipal levy for the previous year that applied to property in the municipality, determine the previous year’s levy amount under subsection (2). 2.  Despite paragraph 1, only general or special levies that applied in the previous year to at least 50 per cent of the sum of the assessments for the taxation year for property in the property class in the municipality are included for the purposes of this subsection. 3.  Determine the total weighted assessment for the municipality by adding the weighted assessment for the taxation year, as determined under subsection (4), for each property class to which the levy applied. 4.  For each levy, determine the residential rate to raise the previous year’s levy by dividing the previous year’s levy amount, referred to in paragraph 1, by the total weighted assessment determined under paragraph 3. 5.  For each levy, determine a class rate to raise the previous year’s levy for each property class for the taxation year by multiplying the residential rate to raise the previous year’s levy, as determined under paragraph 4, by the tax ratio for the property class for the taxation year. 6.

Apply the tax rate for the previous year for each property class to the total assessment for property in the property class to which the levy applied, as determined under subsection (3). 2.  The previous year’s levy amount is the sum of the amounts determined under paragraph 1 for the property classes.  O. Reg. 73/03, s. 12 (2).

Reg. 62/17, s. 7 (2). (3.1.2) An upper-tier municipality may, by by-law passed before February 28 of the year, or before April 30 if the year is 2017, delegate to each of its lower-tier municipalities the authority to pass a by-law under subsection (3.1) in respect of levies for lower-tier purposes. O. Reg. 62/17, s. 7 (2). (3.2) A municipality that has passed a by-law under subsection (3.1) shall adjust the total assessment for property in a property class in the municipality, as determined under subsection (3), so that the total assessment for property in a property class in the municipality excludes changes to the tax roll for the previous year resulting from one or more of the following events, except as provided by subsection (3.3): 1.  A correction under subsection 32 (1.1) of the Assessment Act. 2.  An assessment under subsection 32 (4) of the Assessment Act. 3.  A reconsideration under section 39.1 of the Assessment Act. 4.

(3.3) Subject to subsection (3.4), if an event listed in paragraphs 3 to 5 of subsection (3.2) changes the assessed value of a property because of one of the following types of changes, the change to the assessed value of the property shall, despite subsection (3.2), be included in the total assessment for property in the property class: 1.  A change with respect to which an additional assessment of land is made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act. 2.  A change to the state or condition of land that results in the assessment made under section 36 of the Assessment Act for the taxation year differing from the assessment for the previous taxation year. 3.  A change in the classification of land, except under section 30, 34 or 38 of Ontario Regulation 282/98 (General) made under the Assessment Act. 4.  A change in the status of land from taxable to tax-exempt or vice-versa. 5.  A change in the valuation approach with respect to whether land is eligible for assessment under section 19.0.1 of the Assessment Act. O. Reg. 62/17, s. 7 (2); O. Reg. 65/19, s. 5.

O. Reg. 73/03, s. 12 (5); O. Reg. 14/22, s. 5 (3). (6) Despite paragraph 6 of subsection (1), if the Municipal Extra Territorial Tax Act applies to the property, the notional tax rate for 2005 or a subsequent taxation year to raise the previous year’s levies is the sum of the class rates for the previous year, as determined under paragraph 5 of subsection (1), for the applicable property class.

(1) This section applies to determine, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of subsection 329 (2) of the Act, the amount of taxes for the previous year if two or more parcels of land that were included on the assessment roll for taxation in the previous year are consolidated into one consolidated parcel on the assessment roll for the taxation year.  O. Reg. 450/03, s. 3. (2) The amount of the taxes for the previous year for the consolidated parcel is the sum of the taxes for municipal and school purposes levied on the separate parcels for the previous year if the property class in which each separate parcel was included for the previous year and the property class in which the consolidated parcel is included for the taxation year are the same.  O. Reg. 450/03, s. 3. (3) Subject to subsection (4), if two or more separate parcels were included in different property classes in the previous year to which Part IX of the Act applied and portions of the consolidated parcel are in the same property classes in the taxation year as the separate parcels, the amount of taxes for the previous year for the portion of the consolidated parcel that is in the same property class for the taxation year as the corresponding separate parcel in the previous year is the amount of taxes for municipal and school purposes levied for the previous year on the separate parcel.  O. Reg. 450/03, s. 3. (4) If any of the separate parcels was included in the subclass for vacant land for the previous year and the corresponding portion of the consolidated parcel is included for the taxation year in the subclass for excess land, (a)  the amount of the taxes for the previous year for the portion of the consolidated parcel that is included in the subclass for excess land in the taxation year is the amount of the taxes for municipal and school purposes that was levied on the separate parcel included in the subclass for vacant land for the previous year; and (b)  the amount of the taxes for the previous year for each portion of the consolidated parcel that is not included in the subclass for excess land in the taxation year is the amount of the taxes for municipal and school purposes that was levied for the previous year on the corresponding separate parcel if it was included in the same property class in the previous year as the portion of the consolidated parcel.  O. Reg. 450/03, s. 3. (5) If two or more of the separate parcels were included in the same property class to which Part IX of the Act applied in the previous year but only a portion of the consolidated parcel is included in that property class in the taxation year, the amount of the taxes for the previous year for that portion of the consolidated parcel is the amount determined in the following manner: 1.  Determine the average level of taxation of the separate parcels for the previous year. 2.  Determine the tax rate levied by the municipality for the previous year on property in the same property class as that portion of the consolidated parcel. 3.  Determine the assessment on the portion for the taxation year. 4.  Determine the total assessment of the consolidated parcel. 5.  Divide the amount determined under paragraph 3 by the amount determined under paragraph 4. 6.  Determine the total assessment of the separate parcels for the previous year. 7.  Multiply the quotient determined under paragraph 5 by the amount determined under paragraph 6. 8.  Multiply the average level of taxation determined under paragraph 1 for the previous year by the tax rate determined under paragraph 2 for the previous year. 9.

Determine, i.  the level of taxation for the previous year of the separate parcel that was included in the same property class in the previous year as the consolidated parcel, if only one separate parcel was in the same property class for the previous year as the consolidated parcel, or ii.  the average level of taxation for the previous year of the separate parcels that were included in the same property class in the previous year as the consolidated parcel, if more than one separate parcel was in the same property class for the previous year as the consolidated parcel. 2.  Determine the sum of the assessments for the previous year of all of the separate parcels that were in different property classes for the previous year than the consolidated parcel. 3.  Determine the tax rate levied by the municipality for the previous year on property in the same property class as the consolidated parcel. 4.  Multiply the sum of the assessments determined under paragraph 2 by the tax rate referred to in paragraph 3. 5.  Multiply the product determined under paragraph 4 by the lesser of, i.  1.00, and ii.  the level of taxation or average level of taxation for the previous year determined under paragraph 1. 6.  Add the product determined under paragraph 5 to the taxes determined for the previous year under section 329, 330 or 331 of the Act for all of the separate parcels that were included in the same property class in the previous year as the consolidated parcel.  O. Reg. 450/03, s. 3. (7) The amount of taxes for municipal and school purposes of the consolidated parcel for the previous year is the amount determined under subsection (8) if, (a)  two or more of the separate parcels that were consolidated for the taxation year were included in different property classes for the previous year; (b)  not all of the separate parcels that were consolidated were included in property classes that were subject to Part IX of the Act for the previous year; (c)  the consolidated parcel is included in a single property class that is subject to Part IX of the Act for the taxation year; and (d)  the property class in which the consolidated parcel is included for the taxation year is the same as the property class in which one of the separate parcels was included in the previous year.  O. Reg. 450/03, s. 3. (8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the amount is determined as follows: 1.  Determine, i.  the level of taxation for the previous year of the separate parcel that was included in the same property class in the previous year as the consolidated parcel, if only one separate parcel was in the same property class for the previous year as the consolidated parcel, or ii.  the average level of taxation for the previous year of the separate parcels that were included in the same property class in the previous year as the consolidated parcel, if more than one separate parcel was in the same property class for the previous year as the consolidated parcel. 2.  Determine the sum of the assessments for the previous year of all separate parcels that were included in property classes that were not subject to Part IX of the Act. 3.  Determine the tax rate levied by the municipality for the previous year on property in the same property class as the consolidated parcel. 4.
