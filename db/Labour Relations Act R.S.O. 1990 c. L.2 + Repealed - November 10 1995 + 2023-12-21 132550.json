Initiation (1.1) For the purposes of this section, first agreement arbitration is considered to have been initiated on the date on which a request described in clause (1)(a) is made or on the date on which a direction described in clause (1)(b) is made. Arbitration on request (1.2) A party may make a request to the Minister for first agreement arbitration, (a) if thirty days have elapsed since the day on which it became lawful for the employees to strike and the employer to lock out employees; and (b) if no collective agreement has been entered into. Arbitration on application to the Board (1.3) A party may apply to the Board for first agreement arbitration, (a) if the Minister has released a notice that it is not considered advisable to appoint a conciliation board or the Minister has released the report of a conciliation board; and (b) if the parties are unable to effect a first collective agreement. Proposed collective agreement (1.4) The party seeking first agreement arbitration shall include with the request or application a copy of a proposed collective agreement which the party is prepared to execute and shall provide a copy of it to the other party to the negotiations.

Duty of Board (2) The Board shall consider and make its decision on an application under subsection (1.3) within thirty days of receiving the application and it shall direct the settlement of a first collective agreement by arbitration where, irrespective of whether section 15 has been contravened, it appears to the Board that the process of collective bargaining has been unsuccessful because of, (a) the refusal of the employer to recognize the bargaining authority of the trade union; (b) the uncompromising nature of any bargaining position adopted by the respondent without reasonable justification; (c) the failure of the respondent to make reasonable or expeditious efforts to conclude a collective agreement; or (d) any other reason the Board considers relevant. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.41(2); 1992, c.21, s.19(2). Board of arbitration (3) If first agreement arbitration is initiated, a board of arbitration composed of three members shall settle the first collective agreement between the parties. Final offer selection (3.1) The parties may agree that the board of arbitration shall settle the first collective agreement by final offer selection. Appointments to board (4) Each party shall appoint one member of the board of arbitration within ten days after first agreement arbitration is initiated and shall inform the other party of its appointee. Idem (5) Within five days after the second of the members is appointed to the board of arbitration, the two appointees shall appoint a third member of the board who shall act as its chair. 1992, c.21, s.19(3). Idem (6) If a party fails to make an appointment as required by subsection (4) or if the appointees fail to agree upon a chair within the time limited, the appointment shall be made by the Minister upon the request of either party.

Idem (7) A board of arbitration appointed under this section shall determine its own procedure but shall give full opportunity to the parties to present their evidence and make their submissions and section 110 applies to the board of arbitration, its decision and proceedings as if it were the Board. Idem (8) The remuneration and expenses of the members of a board of arbitration appointed under this section shall be paid as follows: 1. A party shall pay the remuneration and expenses of the member appointed by or on behalf of the party. 2. Each party shall pay one-half of the remuneration and expenses of the chair. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.41(7,8). Idem (9) Subsections 6(8), (9), (10), (12), (13), (14), (17) and (18) of the Hospital Labour Disputes Arbitration Act and subsections 45(8.1) and (10) of this Act apply with necessary modifications to a board of arbitration established under this section. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.41(9); 1992, c.21, s.19(5). Idem (10) The date of the first hearing of a board of arbitration appointed under this section shall not be later than twenty-one days after the appointment of the chair. Idem (11) A board of arbitration appointed under this section shall determine all matters in dispute and release its decision within forty-five days of the commencement of its hearing of the matter. Mediation (12) The Minister may appoint a mediator to confer with the parties and endeavour to effect a settlement. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.41(10-12). No strike or lock-out (13) If first agreement arbitration is initiated, the employees in the bargaining unit shall not strike and the employer shall not lock out the employees. Termination of strike (13.1) If first agreement arbitration is initiated during a strike or lock-out, the employees shall forthwith terminate the strike and the employer shall forthwith terminate the lock-out. Reinstatement (13.2) Upon the termination of a strike or lock-out, the employer shall forthwith reinstate the employees in the bargaining unit in the employment they had at the time the strike or lock-out began, (a) in accordance with any agreement between the employer and the trade union respecting reinstatement of the employees; or (b) if there is no agreement respecting reinstatement, on the basis of the length of service of each employee in relation to that of the other employees in the bargaining unit employed at the time the strike or lock-out began, except as the Board may order for the purpose of allowing the employer to start up operations. 1992, c.21, s.19(6). Non-application (14) The requirement to reinstate employees applies despite the fact that replacement employees may be performing the work of employees in the bargaining unit, but subsection (13.1) does not apply so as to require reinstatement of an employee where, because of the permanent discontinuance of all or part of the business of the employer, the employer no longer has persons engaged in performing work of the same or a similar nature to work which the employee performed before the strike or lock-out. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.41(14); 1992, c.21, s.19(7). Working conditions (15) If first agreement arbitration is initiated, the rates of wages and all other terms and conditions of employment and all rights, privileges and duties of the employer, the employees and the trade union in effect at the time notice was given under section 14 shall continue in effect or, if altered before first agreement arbitration was initiated, be restored and continued in effect until the first collective agreement is settled unless the parties otherwise agree. 1992, c.21, s.19(8). Non-application (16) Subsection (15) does not apply so as to effect any alteration in rates of wages or in any other term or condition of employment agreed to by the employer and the trade union. Matters to be accepted or considered (17) In arbitrating the settlement of a first collective agreement under this section, matters agreed to by the parties, in writing, shall be accepted without amendment. Effect of settlement (18) A first collective agreement settled under this section is effective for a period of two years from the date on which it is settled and it may provide that any of the terms of the agreement, except its term of operation, shall be retroactive to the day that the Board may fix, but not earlier than the day on which notice was given under section 14. Extension of time (19) The parties, by agreement in writing, or the Minister may extend any time limit set out in this section, despite the expiration of the time. Non-application (20) This section does not apply to the negotiation of a first collective agreement, (a) where one of the parties is an employers’ organization accredited under section 129 as a bargaining agent for employers; or (b) where the agreement is a provincial agreement within the meaning of section 139. Application (21) This section applies to an employer and a trade union where the trade union has acquired or acquires bargaining rights for employees of the employer before or after the 26th day of May, 1986, and the bargaining rights have been acquired since the 1st day of January, 1984 and continue to exist at the time of an application under subsection (1). R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.41(16-21).

            "content": "64.  (1) In this section, “business” includes one or more parts of a business; (“entreprise”) “predecessor employer” means an employer who sells his, her or its business; (“employeur précédent”) “sells” includes leases, transfers and any other manner of disposition; (“vend”) “successor employer” means an employer to whom the predecessor employer sells the business. (“employeur qui succède”) Application (1.1) This section applies when a predecessor employer sells a business to a successor employer. Successor employer bound (2) If the predecessor employer is bound by a collective agreement, the successor employer is bound by it as if the successor employer were the predecessor employer, until the Board declares otherwise. 1992, c.21, s.29(1), part. Idem, in proceedings (2.1) If the predecessor employer is a party to any of the following proceedings, the successor employer is a party to the proceeding as if the successor employer were the predecessor employer, until the Board declares otherwise: 1. A proceeding before the Board under any Act. 2. A proceeding before another person or body under this Act, the Hospital Labour Disputes Arbitration Act, the Crown Employees Collective Bargaining Act, 1993 or the Agricultural Labour Relations Act, 1994. 3. A proceeding before the Board or another person or body relating to the collective agreement. 1992, c.21, s.29(1), part; 1994, c.6, s.27(3). Idem, by notices (2.2) If the predecessor employer has given or been given a notice relating to bargaining for a collective agreement or has requested the appointment of a conciliation officer or mediator, the successor employer is considered to have given or been given the notice or to have made the request, until the Board declares otherwise. Trade union continues (3) If, when the predecessor employer sells the business, a trade union is the bargaining agent for any employees of the predecessor employer, has applied to become their bargaining agent or is attempting to persuade the employees to join the trade union, the trade union continues in the same position in respect of the business as if the successor employer were the predecessor employer. Disputes (4) An interested person, trade union or council of trade unions may apply to the Board to determine, (a) a question concerning the scope of bargaining rights of the trade union referred to in subsection (3); or (b) a conflict in the bargaining rights of the trade union referred to in subsection (3) and another trade union representing employees of the successor employer. Bargaining unit (4.1) On an application under clause (4)(a), the Board may alter the composition of the bargaining unit for which the trade union referred to in subsection (3) holds bargaining rights.

Termination of bargaining rights (5) An interested person, trade union or council of trade unions may apply to the Board within sixty days after the predecessor employer sells the business for the termination of the bargaining rights of the trade union referred to in subsection (3). Idem (5.1) On an application under subsection (5), the Board may terminate the bargaining rights of the trade union only if it considers that the successor employer has changed the character of the business so that it is substantially different from the business of the predecessor employer. Miscellaneous powers (6) This subsection applies if the successor employer carries on one or more other businesses and the successor employer intermingles the employees of the business sold to him, her or it with those of another business. On application, the Board may, (a) declare that the successor employer is no longer bound by the collective agreement to which the predecessor employer was bound; (b) determine the unit or units of employees that are appropriate for collective bargaining; (c) declare which trade union or council of trade unions, if any, becomes the bargaining agent for the employees in each of the bargaining units; (d) amend, to the extent the Board considers necessary, any certificate issued to a trade union or council of trade unions or any bargaining unit defined in any collective agreement; and (e) define or redefine the seniority rights under any collective agreement of the employees concerned. 1992, c.21, s.29(1), part. Notice to bargain (7) Where a trade union or council of trade unions is declared to be the bargaining agent under clause (6)(c) and it is not already bound by a collective agreement with the successor employer with respect to the employees for whom it is declared to be the bargaining agent, it is entitled to give to the employer a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement, and the notice has the same effect as a notice under section 14. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.64(7); 1992, c.21, s.29(2). Powers of Board before disposing of application (8) Before disposing of any application under this section, the Board may make such inquiry, may require the production of such evidence and the doing of such things, or may hold such representation votes, as it considers appropriate. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.64(8); 1993, c.27, Sched. Where employer not required to bargain (9) Where an application is made under this section, an employer is not required, despite the fact that a notice has been given by a trade union or council of trade unions, to bargain with that trade union or council of trade unions concerning the employees to whom the application relates until the Board has disposed of the application and has declared which trade union or council of trade unions, if any, has the right to bargain with the employer on behalf of the employees concerned in the application. R.S.O. 1990, c.L.2, s.64(9). Effect of declaration (10) A declaration under subsection (6) has the same effect as a certification under section 9.1, for the purposes of sections 5 (application for certification), 58 (application for termination), 60 (termination of bargaining rights), 62 (application for certification or termination) and 125 (application for termination). 1992, c.21, s.29(3). Successor municipalities (11) Where one or more municipalities as defined in the Municipal Affairs Act is erected into another municipality, or two or more such municipalities are amalgamated, united or otherwise joined together, or all or part of one such municipality is annexed, attached or added to another such municipality, the employees of the municipalities concerned shall be deemed to have been intermingled, and, (a) the Board may exercise the like powers as it may exercise under subsections (6) and (8) with respect to the sale of a business under this section; (b) the new or enlarged municipality has the like rights and obligations as a person to whom a business is sold under this section and who intermingles the employees of two of the person’s businesses; and (c) any trade union or council of trade unions concerned has the like rights and obligations as it would have in the case of the intermingling of employees in two or more businesses under this section. Power of Board to determine whether sale (12) Where, on any application under this section or in any other proceeding before the Board, a question arises as to whether a business has been sold by one employer to another, the Board shall determine the question and its decision is final and conclusive for the purposes of this Act. Duty of respondents (13) Where, on an application under this section, a trade union alleges that the sale of a business has occurred, the respondents to the application shall adduce at the hearing all facts within their knowledge that are material to the allegation.
