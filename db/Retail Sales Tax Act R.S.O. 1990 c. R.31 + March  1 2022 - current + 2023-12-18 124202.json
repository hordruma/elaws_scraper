Overpayment refunded (14) Subject to subsection 18 (8), subsection 19 (3) and to subsection 20 (9), where an assessment or reassessment under this Act or the final decision of a court in proceedings commenced under section 25 establishes that the person assessed or reassessed or the appellant, as the case may be, has overpaid the tax payable under this Act for the period covered by the assessment or reassessment, the amount of such overpayment shall be refunded to the person.

Same (16.0.1) The following are the circumstances in which a vendor may refund to a purchaser all or part of the tax collected by the vendor from the purchaser: 1.

The purchaser acquired from the vendor the goods on which a refund of tax is sought for the purpose of reselling the goods, and after the sale and before the refund is made provides the vendor with a proper purchase exemption certificate with respect to the goods. 3.

Same (16.0.3) Despite subsection (16.0.2), a vendor may not deduct the amount of a refund to a purchaser from a subsequent remittance to a person authorized under subsection 11 (1) to collect the tax from the vendor.  2002, c. 22, s. 171 (3). Same (16.0.4) If subsection (16.0.3) applies with respect to a vendor, the Minister may refund to the vendor the amount of a refund to a purchaser referred to in subsection (16).  2002, c. 22, s. 171 (3).

Same (16.2) Despite subsection (11), where a policy dividend or an experience rating refund is paid to a person who has entered into a contract of insurance, the insurer may refund an additional amount on account of tax if the premiums paid by the person were subject to tax under this Act and if the refund is made within four years following the due date of the original premium.  1994, c. 13, s. 2 (5). Refund, reduction in tax (16.3) Despite subsection (11), any amount of tax paid before, on or after May 3, 2000 in respect of a premium payment due after May 2, 2000 under a contract of automobile insurance that exceeds the amount of tax payable under this section in respect of that premium payment may be refunded by the vendor to the person from whom the vendor collected the tax.  However, no refund shall be made more than four years after the date on which the tax to be refunded was paid.  2000, c. 10, s. 25. Deduction of refund (16.4) Any refund made under subsection (16.1), (16.2) or (16.3) may be deducted by the vendor from subsequent remittances of tax under this Act, if the vendor takes the deduction within four years from the date of the refund to the person who paid the premiums.  2000, c. 10, s. 25. Refund not to include tax (17) Where the erroneous payment giving rise to a claim for a refund under subsection (11) or (14) is the result of a sale under a contract in which a party other than the applicant for the refund is the purchaser who should have paid the tax or any part thereof a refund of which is sought, and where such tax, had it been properly paid, can reasonably be considered to have been likely to form a part of the contract price that would have been charged to the person claiming the refund, the Minister may, despite subsection (11) or (14), determine by such method or formula as he or she considers appropriate the amount by which the payment sought to be refunded exceeds the tax that would have been properly payable in the performance of the contract, and shall refund only the amount of such excess so determined.  R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31, s. 2 (17). Tangible personal property brought into or received in Ontario (18) Every person who brings into Ontario or who receives delivery in Ontario of tangible personal property acquired by the person for value for his, her or its own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use of other persons at his, her or its expense, or on behalf of, or as agent for, a principal who desires to acquire such property for the consumption or use by such principal or other persons at his, her or its expense, shall immediately report the matter in writing to the Minister and shall supply the Minister with the invoice and all other pertinent information required by him or her in respect of the consumption or use of such property and at the same time shall pay to Her Majesty in right of Ontario the same tax in respect of the consumption and use of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at a retail sale in Ontario at the time such tangible personal property is brought into Ontario or delivery thereof is received in Ontario together with any tax payable under section 4.  R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31, s. 2 (18); 1994, c. 13, s. 2 (6). Calculation of tax (19) The tax imposed by this Act shall be calculated separately on every purchase and shall be computed to the nearest cent, and every fraction of less than one-half cent shall not be counted and every fraction of one-half cent or more shall be counted as one cent, but, where on the same occasion or as part of one transaction several items of tangible personal property are purchased, the total of the purchase shall be deemed to be one purchase for the purposes of this Act.  R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31, s. 2 (19). Tax on merchandise tendered in trade (20) Where tangible personal property is accepted at the time of sale by a person or a vendor on account of the price of other tangible personal property sold, the purchaser shall pay the tax under subsection (1) calculated on the difference between the fair value of the property sold and the credit allowed for the tangible personal property accepted on account of the purchase price in trade.  R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31, s. 2 (20); 1993, c. 12, s. 2 (4); 2010, c. 26, Sched. 17, s. 2. Exception (20.1) Subsection (20) does not apply if any purchaser could acquire the tangible personal property exempt from tax imposed by this Act at the time it is so accepted.  1993, c. 12, s. 2 (5). If exempt property put to taxable use (21) If tangible personal property is purchased exempt from the tax imposed by this Act and the tangible personal property is subsequently put to a taxable use before July 1, 2010, the purchaser shall pay the tax imposed by this Act on the fair value of the tangible personal property at the time of the change in use.  2009, c. 34, Sched. R, s. 1 (2). Tax on promotional distributions (22) The tax payable under this section and section 2.1.1 in respect of tangible personal property, a taxable service or an admission that is supplied on a promotional distribution, (a)  is payable by the person to whom the promotional distribution is made in the amount determined by applying the appropriate tax rate to the amount, if any, paid or payable by the person for the tangible personal property, taxable service or admission, as the case may be; and (b)  is payable by the promotional distributor in the amount determined by applying the appropriate tax rate to the amount by which the full fair value of the tangible personal property or taxable service, or the full price of admission, exceeds the amount, if any, paid or payable to the promotional distributor by the person to whom the promotional distribution is made.  1997, c. 43, Sched.
