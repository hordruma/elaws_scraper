Principles (2) Every new or modified poverty reduction strategy is to be based on the following principles: Importance of all Ontarians 1. That there is untapped potential in Ontario’s population that needs to be drawn upon by building and establishing supports for, and eliminating barriers to, full participation by all people in Ontario’s economy and society and, in particular, persons who face discrimination on the grounds of their race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status or disability. Importance of communities 2. That strong, healthy communities are an integral part of the poverty reduction strategy; their potential must be brought to bear on the reduction of poverty. Recognition of diversity 3. That not all groups of people share the same level of risk of poverty.  The poverty reduction strategy must recognize the heightened risk among groups such as immigrants, women, single mothers, people with disabilities, aboriginal peoples and racialized groups. Importance of support and involvement of families 4. That families be supported so that they can play a meaningful role in the reduction of poverty and in promoting opportunity. Respect 5. That all people in Ontario, including those living in poverty, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Involvement 6. That Ontarians, especially people living in poverty, are to be involved in the design and implementation of the strategy. Commitment and co-operation 7. That a sustained commitment to work together to develop strong and healthy children, youth, adults, families and communities is required to effectively reduce poverty. Importance of the third sector 8. That the third sector, including non-profit, charitable and voluntary organizations, are integral to a poverty reduction strategy by delivering the programs and services that matter to people, by strengthening communities and by making a positive contribution to the economy. 2009, c. 10, s. 2 (2). Contents of poverty reduction strategy (3) Every new or modified poverty reduction strategy is to include the following: 1. A specific poverty reduction target. 2. Initiatives designed to improve the economic and social conditions of persons and families living in poverty. 3. Indicators to measure the success of the strategy that are linked to the determinants of poverty, including but not limited to income, education, health, housing and standard of living.  2009, c. 10, s. 2 (3).",
