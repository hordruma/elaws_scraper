Where any activity which otherwise would be exempt under this order is being carried out as or is part of an undertaking for which an environmental assessment (EA) has been accepted and approval to proceed received, the activity shall be carried out in accordance with any terms or conditions in the approval to proceed as well as the conditions of this order. 2. Where any activity which is the subject of this order is being carried out as or is part of another undertaking which is the subject of an exemption order under the Act, the activity exempt under this order shall be carried out in accordance with any terms or conditions in the other exemption order as well as the conditions in this order. CONTAMINANTS STUDY 3. The City of Toronto will complete further studies to determine the quantities and quality of all contaminants (in addition to faecal coliform) that are expected to be present in the Tunnel liquids and Tunnel solids. 4. The City of Toronto will document the information identified in Condition 3 in a report, including information on the existing treatment methods and future treatment options, identified contaminants during the operation of Phase 1 of the Tunnel, and subsequent phases. This report will be submitted to the Director, Approvals Branch, Ministry of Environment and Energy, as part of the application for an approval under the Ontario Water Resources Act. 5. The City of Toronto will make the Contaminants Study available to The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) for consideration and for public review at the time of submission to Approvals Branch. The City of Toronto will directly notify all those parties who have expressed prior interest in this study of its availability. NON-STRUCTURAL PROGRAMS 6. Within three months of the approval of this exemption order, the City of Toronto shall set up a Non-Structural Programs Working Group, to be composed of appropriate City staff and several members of the interested public. The purpose of this Group will be to identify areas of the City where the implementation of non-structural programs to address stormwater and/or CSO needs are feasible. In keeping with the City’s policy on the use of non-structural programs, the Group shall also be responsible for recommending to Council, through the appropriate Committee, those programs which are considered environmentally, technically and economically appropriate. 7. The City of Toronto will aggressively implement its policies on the use of non-structural programs, and Best Management Practices, for CSO control and stormwater management. 8. The City of Toronto shall direct the Non-Structural Programs Working Group to examine the feasibility of implementing non-structural solutions for stormwater management at the Ellis Avenue and Howard Road stormwater outlets. The City of Toronto shall obtain any approvals required under other acts for any changes to the Western Beaches Storage Tunnel project identified and implement the undertaking with those changes. MONITORING PROGRAMS 9. The City of Toronto will develop monitoring programs to, (a) monitor the quantity and quality of discharges from the Tunnel overflow(s) and the quality and quantity of the settled solids within the Tunnel; and (b) monitor the operation and effectiveness of the non-structural programs and the use of Best Management Practices. The City of Toronto will submit a description of the monitoring programs to the Director of Approvals Branch as part of the application for an approval under the Ontario Water Resources Act. 10. The City of Toronto will implement the monitoring programs identified in Condition 9 immediately upon commencement of operation of the Tunnel. The results of the programs will be forwarded to the Director, Central Region, Ministry of Environment and Energy, for information purposes on an annual basis. The monitoring results will also be incorporated into their Sewer System Master Plan (SSMP) where appropriate by following the formal Amending Procedure required by Condition 14, thereby becoming part of any projects identified within the Plan. MAIN TREATMENT PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 11. The City of Toronto will maintain its active participation as an affected party in Metro’s Main Treatment Plant environmental assessment process. The City of Toronto will continue to work with The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto to develop and analyze a reasonable range of alternative methods of treating CSOs and stormwater, and alternative sites for treatment facilities. 12. The City of Toronto will ensure that the planning for any of the remaining tunnel components of the City of Toronto Sewer System Master Plan will not be undertaken in isolation from Metro’s Environmental Assessment process for its future wastewater needs. MASTER PLANNING FOR WASTEWATER SYSTEMS 13. The City of Toronto will participate in any future infrastructure planning initiatives for wastewater systems involving all levels of municipal government in the Metropolitan Toronto area. The City of Toronto will ensure that any infrastructure plans they complete are consistent with the direction and conclusions of such a Metro-wide infrastructure plan. THE CITY OF TORONTO SEWER SYSTEM MASTER PLAN 14. Should the City of Toronto proceed with its existing sewage infrastructure plan, the Sewer System Master Plan, the City will prepare a formal Review Procedure and a formal Amending Procedure for the Sewer System Master Plan to allow for the regular review and update of the Plan. These procedures will be submitted to the Director, Environmental Assessment Branch, Ministry of Environment and Energy, for review and comment. They will also be made available to those members of the public who have expressed an interest in the existing SSMP for review and comment at the time of submission to the Director of the Environmental Assessment Branch. REPORTING ON FULFILMENT OF CONDITIONS 15. Within one year of the approval of this order, the City of Toronto shall advise the Directors of the Environmental Assessment Branch and Central Region in writing of how the conditions of the exemption have been met. Should there be any outstanding work, the City of Toronto will continue to advise the Directors of the Environmental Assessment Branch and Central Region in writing of how the conditions of exemption have been met. 16. Except where otherwise provided for by these conditions, or in an approval issued under the Ontario Water Resources Act, the City of Toronto will carry out the implementation of the Western Beaches Storage Tunnel as defined in the Western Beaches Storage Tunnel Environmental Study Report (July 1993), and the request for exemption submission. IMPLEMENTATION 17. This order expires 2 years after the date that it is approved, or such later date as the Minister of Environment and Energy may specify by notice in writing to the proponent. 18. All other applicable approvals and permits will be obtained for the project. O. Reg. 94/96. ",
