How allowance calculated (2) For the 2021 calendar year and subsequent calendar years, each registered party’s allowance for a quarter is the amount calculated by multiplying $0.636 by the number of valid votes cast for the party’s candidates in the election referred to in subsection (1), whether or not the quarter ended on or after the day the Protecting Ontario Elections Act, 2021 received Royal Assent. 2021, c. 5, Sched. 2, s. 12 (1). Adjusted payment schedule for 2022 and 2023 (2.1) The following adjustments are made respecting the payment of the allowances under subsection (1): 1.  The first payment for the 2022 calendar year shall be the amount otherwise calculated for the first quarter of that year. 2.  The second payment for the 2022 calendar year shall be the amount calculated for the three remaining quarters of that year, plus the amount calculated for the first quarter of the 2023 calendar year. 3.  No further payment shall be made for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year or for the first quarter of the 2023 calendar year. 4.  Commencing with the second quarter of the 2023 calendar year, the payments shall be made as otherwise provided under subsection (1). 2021, c. 5, Sched. 2, s. 12 (2). Merged parties (3) A merged party is entitled to the aggregate of the allowances to which the merging parties of which it is composed would have been entitled if they had not merged. 2016, c. 22, s. 27. Constituency association allowance (4) The Chief Electoral Officer shall determine, for each quarter of a calendar year commencing with the 2017 calendar year, an allowance payable to each registered constituency association. 2016, c. 22, s. 27. How allowance calculated (5) Each registered constituency association’s allowance for a quarter is the amount calculated by the following rules: 1.  For each electoral district, take, i.  $6,250, multiplied by the indexation factor determined for the calendar year under section 40.1, if the calendar year ends on or before December 31, 2023, and ii.  two thirds of the amount determined under subparagraph i for the calendar year 2023, if the calendar year is 2024. 2.  Subject to paragraphs 3, 3.1, and 4, divide the amount determined under paragraph 1 among the registered constituency associations of the electoral district, based on the percentage of the total number of valid votes the registered candidates associated with the registered parties of the constituency associations received in the electoral district at the most recent election. 3. No amount is payable to a registered constituency association where the registered candidate associated with the registered party of the constituency association received fewer than two per cent of the valid votes cast at the most recent election. 3.1  In the case of an independent member, i.  an amount is payable to the member’s registered constituency association based on the percentage of the total number of valid votes the member received as a candidate in the electoral district at the most recent election, and ii.  in addition, if the independent member was elected as a candidate of a registered party, the registered constituency association of the registered party remains entitled to the amount it would otherwise receive. 4.  If, since the most recent election, a redistribution of electoral districts has necessitated changes regarding registered constituency associations in order to align registered constituency associations with the redistributed electoral districts, the amount shall be divided among the registered constituency associations of the redistributed electoral district in a manner determined by the Chief Electoral Officer. 2016, c. 22, s. 27; 2018, c. 17, Sched. 13, s. 5 (2); 2021, c. 5, Sched. 2, s. 12 (3-6). Condition of payment (6) An allowance is only payable to a registered constituency association for a quarter if all documents that it was required to file with the Chief Electoral Officer in the four year period immediately before the quarter have been filed and are complete. 2016, c. 22, s. 27. Exception (7) Despite subsection (6), where a registered constituency association has been endorsed by an independent member who was elected as a candidate of a registered party, an allowance is payable to the registered constituency association for a quarter if all the documents it is required to file with the Chief Electoral Officer have been filed and are complete. 2021, c. 5, Sched. 2, s. 12 (7).
