Exceptions (7) Subsection (5) does not apply in respect of an acquisition of a property if, (a) the cost amount of the property to the taxpayer is greater than the transferor’s proceeds of disposition of the property, as otherwise determined, by reason only of the operation of paragraph 88 (1) (c) or 98 (3) (b) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), as applicable for the purposes of this Act; (b) in the case where the taxpayer is a corporation, the percentage of the taxpayer’s taxable income, for the taxation year in which the taxpayer acquires the property, that is not deemed, or would not be deemed if the taxpayer had had taxable income for that year, to be earned outside Ontario for the purposes of section 39, is less than or equal to, (i) if the transferor is a corporation, the percentage of the transferor’s taxable income, for the taxation year in which the transferor disposed of the property, that is not deemed, or would not be deemed if the transferor had had income for that year, to be earned outside Ontario for the purposes of section 39, or (ii) if the transferor is a partnership, the percentage of the transferor’s income, for the fiscal period in which the transferor disposed of the property, that would not be deemed to be earned outside Ontario under the rules prescribed for the purposes of section 39, if the partnership were a corporation, the fiscal period were its taxation year and it had had income for the fiscal period; or (c) in the case where the taxpayer is a partnership, the percentage of the taxpayer’s income, for the fiscal period in which the taxpayer acquired the property, that would not be deemed to be earned outside Ontario under the rules prescribed for the purposes of section 39 if the partnership were a corporation, the fiscal period were its taxation year and it had had income for the fiscal period, is less than or equal to the percentage of the transferor’s taxable income, for the taxation year in which the transferor disposed of the property, that is not deemed, or would not be deemed if the transferor had had taxable income for that year, to be earned outside Ontario for the purposes of section 39 or, if the transferor is an individual, is deemed, or would be deemed if the transferor had had taxable income for that year, to be earned in Ontario under rules prescribed in the regulations made under the Income Tax Act (Canada).  1997, c. 43, Sched. A, s. 4 (1); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Section not applicable (8) This section does not apply to a disposition or an acquisition of property if, (a) the property is, (i) depreciable property that was included in Class 3 of Schedule II to the regulations made under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and was acquired after November 12, 1981 and before October 25, 1985 by the transferor, (ii) depreciable property referred to in subclause (i) that was acquired from a related corporation, and the difference between the cost amount of the property for the purposes of this Act and the cost amount of the property for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) can be primarily attributed to the fact that subsection 1100 (2) of the regulations made under that Act that applied for the purposes of that Act after November 12, 1981 did not apply for the purposes of this Act before October 25, 1985, or (iii) a foreign resource property; (b) the rules or conditions prescribed by the regulations have been satisfied; or (c) an election is made under subsection 29.1 (4) or 31.1 (4) in respect of the disposition, or could have been made if those subsections had been enacted and in force.  1997, c. 43, Sched.

Same (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a corporation for a taxation year unless the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The corporation’s Ontario allocation factor for a subsequent taxation year, within the meaning of subsection 12 (1), is at least 20 per cent greater than the corporation’s Ontario allocation factor for the taxation year. 2. The amount that would be the corporation’s income or taxable income for the taxation year, determined under this Act before the deduction of any amount deemed by subsection (1) to be deducted or claimed under the provision referred to in that subsection, is greater than the corporation’s income or taxable income, as the case may be, for the taxation year determined under the law of a province other than Ontario because the corporation deducted or claimed a greater amount in determining its income or taxable income under the corresponding provision of the law of the other province. 3. The total amount of all income tax that would be payable by the corporation to one or more provinces for all taxation years commencing with the taxation year and ending with the subsequent taxation year, determined before the deduction of any amount deemed to be claimed or deducted under subsection (1) for the taxation year, is less than the total amount of provincial income tax that would be payable by the corporation for those taxation years, determined after the deduction of the amount deemed to be claimed or deducted under subsection (1) and after all consequential adjustments are made to the corporation’s income and taxable income for those taxation years that would be required by reason of the increase required by subsection (1) in the total amount deducted or claimed under the provision for the taxation year.  1998, c. 34, s. 27 (1); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

Paragraphs 20 (1) (l), (l.1), (m), (m.1), (n) and (o). 2. Subsection 26 (2). 3. Subsection 32 (1). 4. Clauses 40 (1) (a) (iii) (C) and (D). 5. Subparagraphs 138 (3) (a) (i), (ii) and (iv). 6. Such other provisions as may be prescribed by regulation.  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Anti-avoidance, provincial tax (2) The amount of a specified reserve claimed by a corporation in determining its income under Part II for a taxation year shall be deemed to be the amount determined under subsection (4) if the conditions set out in subsection (3) are satisfied.  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). When applicable (3) Subsection (2) applies to a corporation for a taxation year if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The amount of the specified reserve claimed by the corporation is greater than the amount of the specified reserve that it claims for the purposes of determining its income under the laws of another province that impose a similar tax calculated by reference to the corporation’s income or for the purposes of determining the amount of its income under the Income Tax Act (Canada), or the corporation does not claim any amount in respect of the specified reserve in determining its income for the purposes of the income tax laws of another province or under the Income Tax Act (Canada). 2. The corporation’s Ontario allocation factor, as defined in subsection 12 (1), for a subsequent taxation year is at least 20 per cent less than its Ontario allocation factor for the taxation year, or would be at least 20 per cent less if the corporation had tax payable under Part II for the taxation year and subsequent taxation years. 3. It is reasonable to consider that the primary reason that the corporation is claiming different amounts of the specified reserve is to reduce the amount of income taxes payable to one or more provinces over the course of one or more taxation years. 4. The total amount of income tax payable by the corporation under this Act and under the income tax laws of other provinces for the period that includes the taxation year and subsequent taxation years would be less if subsection (2) did not apply.  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Amount deemed to be claimed (4) If subsection (2) applies to a corporation for a taxation year in respect of a specified reserve claimed by the corporation, the amount the corporation is deemed to have claimed for the taxation year is the lesser of, (a) the least of the amounts claimed by the corporation as the specified reserve for the same taxation year in determining the amount of its income for the purposes of the income tax laws of another province or under the Income Tax Act (Canada); or (b) nil, if no specified reserve is claimed by the corporation for the taxation year in determining the amount of its income for the purposes of the income tax laws of another province or under the Income Tax Act (Canada).  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Partnerships (5) If a corporation is a member of a partnership during a taxation year, subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) apply with necessary modifications in determining the corporation’s share of the income or loss of the partnership for a fiscal period ending in the taxation year.  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Amalgamation and winding-up (6) For the purposes of this section, (a) a corporation that is formed as a result of an amalgamation or merger of two or more corporations shall be deemed to be the same corporation as, and a continuation of, each of the corporations that amalgamated or merged; and (b) a corporation that is a parent for the purposes of subsection 88 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), or would be a parent if it were a taxable Canadian corporation, shall be deemed to be the same corporation as, and a continuation of, each corporation that, if it were a taxable Canadian corporation, would be described as a subsidiary in that subsection, after the winding-up of the subsidiary.  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Application (7) This section applies with respect to a corporation’s taxation years that end on or after the day this section comes into force.  1999, c. 9, s. 74; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

If the associated corporation has two or more taxation years ending in the corporation’s taxation year, the taxable income of the associated corporation for the last taxation year ending on or before the last day of the corporation’s taxation year is deemed to be the aggregate of all amounts, each of which is the taxable income of the associated corporation for each taxation year which ended in the corporation’s taxation year and during which the associated corporation was at any time associated with the corporation, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the total number of days in all of those taxation years.  1992, c. 3, s. 9; 1994, c. 14, s. 15 (2); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

If the rules in subsection 88 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) applied to the winding-up of a subsidiary corporation, its parent corporation shall be deemed to be the same corporation as and a continuation of the subsidiary corporation for the purposes of determining an amount of tax under Part II.1 deducted under this section or payable by the parent corporation for a prior taxation year. 4.

Paragraph 4 does not apply unless, i. before the later of the date determined under paragraph 142.7 (11) (b) of the Income Tax Act\r\n(Canada) and the day that is 180 days after the day the Budget Measures Act (Fall), 2004 receives Royal Assent, A. the entrant bank and the Canadian affiliate jointly elect that paragraph 4 applies, if the Canadian affiliate has not been wound up or dissolved before the election is made, or B. the entrant bank elects that paragraph 4 applies, if the Canadian affiliate has been wound up or dissolved and has ceased to exist before the election is made, or ii. the entrant bank and the Canadian affiliate have jointly elected under paragraph 142.7 (12) (c) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) to have section 142.7 of that Act apply. 6. Paragraph 4 applies only to, i. taxation years for which an election by the affiliate and bank under paragraph 142.7 (12) (c) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) applies or to which section 142.7 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) would have applied if an election had been made under paragraph 142.7 (12) (c) of that Act, and ii. preceding taxation years in which a credit under this section was earned.  1994, c. 14, s. 17 (1); 2002, c. 22, s. 45; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2); 2004, c. 31, Sched. 9, s. 17.

Same (2) A corporation that complies with the requirements of this section may deduct from its tax otherwise payable for the year under Parts III and IV an amount not exceeding the amount by which its co-operative education tax credit for the taxation year exceeds the maximum amount, if any, deductible by the corporation for the year under subsection (1).  1996, c. 24, s. 27; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Amount of tax credit (3) The amount of a corporation’s co-operative education tax credit for a taxation year is the sum of, (a) all amounts each of which is in respect of a qualifying work placement that ends in the taxation year, equal to the lesser of the corporation’s eligible amount for the taxation year in respect of the qualifying work placement determined under subsection (3.1) and $1,000; and (b) the total of all amounts, each of which is an amount determined by multiplying the eligible percentage by the amount of a repayment, if any, made by the corporation during the taxation year, of government assistance in respect of a qualifying work placement to the extent the repayment does not exceed the amount of the assistance in respect of the qualifying work placement that, (i) has not been repaid in a prior taxation year, and (ii) can reasonably be considered to have reduced the amount of a co-operative education tax credit that would otherwise have been allowed to the corporation under this Act in respect of the qualifying work placement.  1997, c. 43, Sched. A, s. 18 (1); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the corporation in the previous taxation year is not greater than $400,000, the amount is 15 per cent of the total of all eligible expenditures made by the corporation in respect of the qualifying work placement. 3. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the corporation in the previous taxation year is greater than $400,000 but less than $600,000, the amount is the amount determined in accordance with the following formula: A = (10% × B) + [(5% × B) × (1 – C/$200,000)] where, “A” is the corporation’s eligible amount for the taxation year in respect of the qualifying work placement, “B” is the amount of all eligible expenditures made by the corporation in respect of the qualifying work placement, and “C” is the amount by which the total of all salaries or wages paid by the corporation in the previous taxation year exceeds $400,000. 1997, c. 43, Sched. A, s. 18 (1); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

A, s. 18 (2); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

A, s. 18 (3); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Minister’s direction and order (5.1) If incorrect certifications have been given under subsection (4) or an eligible educational institution has certified a work placement to be a qualifying work placement when it was not, the Minister may direct the educational institution to cease certifying work placements and may order that all or certain of the work placements of the institution be deemed not to be qualifying work placements for the purposes of this section until the Minister revokes the direction and order.  1996, c. 29, s. 49 (3); 1997, c. 43, Sched. A, s. 18 (4); 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).

Limited partner (7) Despite subsection (6), a limited partner’s share of a partnership’s tax credit referred to in subsection (6) shall be deemed to be nil.  1996, c. 24, s. 27; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2). Deemed tax payment (8) A corporation shall be deemed to pay on account of its tax payable under this Act for a taxation year an amount claimed by the corporation, not exceeding the amount, if any, by which, (a) the corporation’s co-operative education tax credit for the taxation year, exceeds, (b) the maximum amount, if any, deductible by the corporation under subsections (1) and (2) in determining its tax payable under this Act for the taxation year.  1996, c. 24, s. 27; 2004, c. 16, s. 2 (2).
