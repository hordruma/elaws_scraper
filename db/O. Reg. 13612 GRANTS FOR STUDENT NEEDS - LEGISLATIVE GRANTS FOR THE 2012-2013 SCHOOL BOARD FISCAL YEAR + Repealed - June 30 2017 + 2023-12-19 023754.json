An occasional teacher who is assigned to provide instruction to pupils of the board in a regular timetable in effect on October 31, 2012 is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section unless the teacher whom the occasional teacher replaces is included in determining the number of teachers employed by the board under subsection (4) and the board can reasonably expect the teacher to resume instructional duties with the board in the fiscal year.  O. Reg. 269/12, s. 9. (6) In this section, a cell of Table 13 is referred to by its qualification category co-ordinate followed by the number co-ordinate representing the number of full years of teaching experience.  For example, cell C-1 of Table 13 contains the number 0.6185 and cell A1/group 1-3 contains the number 0.7359.  O. Reg. 269/12, s. 9. (7) The following rules apply in determining the actual number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher: 1. The actual number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2012-2013 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s actual number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number. 2. If the actual number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, the actual number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher is deemed to be 10. 3. The actual number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be 10.  O. Reg. 269/12, s. 9. (8) The following rules apply in determining the adjusted number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher: 1. The adjusted number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2011-2012 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s adjusted number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number. 2. If the adjusted number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, the adjusted number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher is deemed to be 10. 3. The adjusted number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be 10.  O. Reg. 269/12, s. 9. (9) The following rules apply, as of October 31, 2012, to determine the actual qualification category of a teacher: 1.

If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2012 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2012-2013 school year and October 31, 2012, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. 9. The 2005 Data Form A, referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, is available as described in subsection 3 (6).  O. Reg. 269/12, s. 9. (10) The following rules apply, as of October 31, 2012, to determine the adjusted qualification category of a teacher: 1. If the teacher has not been employed to teach by a district school board, a school authority or a school established under section 13 of the Act in any school year prior to the 2012-2013 school year, the rules set out in subsection (9) apply to that teacher. 2. If the teacher was counted as a teacher under section 41 of the 2011-2012 grant regulation, that teacher’s qualification category is the same qualification category that he or she had under that section. 3. If the teacher has been employed to teach by a district school board, a school authority or a school established under section 13 of the Act in any school year prior to the 2012-2013 school year, but was not counted as a teacher under section 41 of the 2011-2012 grant regulation, that teacher’s qualification category is the qualification category that he or she would have had under that section if he or she had been a teacher employed by the board as of October 31, 2011 to teach.
