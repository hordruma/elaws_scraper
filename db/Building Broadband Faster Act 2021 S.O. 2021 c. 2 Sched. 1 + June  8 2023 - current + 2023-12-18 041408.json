Administrative penalty may be imposed with other measures (4) An administrative penalty may be imposed alone or in conjunction with any other regulatory measure provided by this or any other Act, and may be imposed in conjunction with a fine imposed for the same infraction. Limitation (5) An administrative penalty may only be imposed within the prescribed time period. No right to be heard (6) There is no right to be heard before an order imposing an administrative penalty is made. Right to review (7) A person who receives an order imposing an administrative penalty may request a prescribed individual to review the order by applying to the prescribed individual for a review in a form approved by the Minister, (a)  within a prescribed number of days after the order is served; or (b)  within a longer period specified by the prescribed individual, if the prescribed individual considers it appropriate in the circumstances to extend the time for applying.

Decision final (12) The prescribed individual’s decision is final.
