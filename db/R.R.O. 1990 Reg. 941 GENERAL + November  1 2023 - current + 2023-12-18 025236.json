It is the duty of a practitioner to the public, to the practitioner’s employer, to the practitioner’s clients, to other members of the practitioner’s profession, and to the practitioner to act at all times with, i.  fairness and loyalty to the practitioner’s associates, employer, clients, subordinates and employees, ii.  fidelity to public needs, iii.  devotion to high ideals of personal honour and professional integrity, iv.  knowledge of developments in the area of professional engineering relevant to any services that are undertaken, and v.  competence in the performance of any professional engineering services that are undertaken. 2.  A practitioner shall, i.  regard the practitioner’s duty to public welfare as paramount, ii.  endeavour at all times to enhance the public regard for the practitioner’s profession by extending the public knowledge thereof and discouraging untrue, unfair or exaggerated statements with respect to professional engineering, iii.  not express publicly, or while the practitioner is serving as a witness before a court, commission or other tribunal, opinions on professional engineering matters that are not founded on adequate knowledge and honest conviction, iv.  endeavour to keep the practitioner’s licence, temporary licence, provisional licence, limited licence or certificate of authorization, as the case may be, permanently displayed in the practitioner’s place of business. 3.  A practitioner shall act in professional engineering matters for the practitioner’s employer as a faithful agent or trustee and shall regard as confidential information obtained by the practitioner as to the business affairs, technical methods or processes of an employer and avoid or disclose a conflict of interest that might influence the practitioner’s actions or judgment. 4.  A practitioner must disclose immediately to the practitioner’s client any interest, direct or indirect, that might be construed as prejudicial in any way to the professional judgment of the practitioner in rendering service to the client. 5.  A practitioner who is an employee-engineer and is contracting in the practitioner’s own name to perform professional engineering work for other than the practitioner’s employer, must provide the practitioner’s client with a written statement of the nature of the practitioner’s status as an employee and the attendant limitations on the practitioner’s services to the client, must satisfy the practitioner that the work will not conflict with the practitioner’s duty to the practitioner’s employer, and must inform the practitioner’s employer of the work. 6.
