            "content": "14.(1)In this section, “local board” means a local board as defined in the Municipal Affairs Act. Annexations (2)Upon the application of any municipality authorized by by-law of the council thereof or upon the application of the Minister authorized by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, or upon the application of at least twenty-five inhabitants, being Canadian citizens of the full age of eighteen years, the Municipal Board may by order on such terms as it may consider expedient, annex any locality that does not form part of any municipality to the municipality and any such order may annex a greater or smaller area or areas than the area or areas specified in the application. Assent of electors (3)The Municipal Board, before proceeding with the application of the council of any municipality under subsection (2), may require that the by-law of the council shall receive the assent of the electors of such municipality. Public hearing to be held by Board (4)The Municipal Board before making any order under subsection (2), shall hold a public hearing, after such notice thereof has been given as the Board may direct, for the purpose of inquiring into the merits of the application and of hearing any objections that any person may desire to bring to the attention of the Board. Effect of official plan (5)Where in a municipality affected by a proposed annexation an official plan approved under the Planning Act or a predecessor thereof is in effect and a by-law of a municipality is passed to authorize an application for an order of the Municipal Board under this section, and a certified copy of the by-law has been sent to the Minister and to the planning board or planning boards having jurisdiction in any area affected by the application, the by-law shall not be deemed to be or be held invalid on the ground that it conflicts with the official plan. Division into wards (6)The Municipal Board may order a division or redivision of a municipality into wards if, in the opinion of the Board, the annexation renders such division or redivision necessary or desirable. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 14 (1-6). Further powers of Municipal Board (7)The Municipal Board may, by any order made pursuant to an application under this section or by subsequent order or orders, (a) make all such adjustments of assets and liabilities as between the municipality and any local board affected by any such order as may be agreed upon or, in default of agreement, as the Board may consider equitable; (b) create, amalgamate or dissolve such local boards and make such adjustments of assets and liabilities of local boards as may be agreed upon or, in default of agreement, as the Board may consider equitable; (c) define special areas within the municipality as enlarged by such annexation having regard to the areas annexed thereto, and adjust the rights, claims, liabilities and obligations of the ratepayers of such areas and provide the extent to which the liabilities of such municipality shall be discharged by the imposition of rates upon the rateable property in such areas; (d) appoint one or more referees, who shall have all the powers mentioned in section 53 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act, to inquire into and report to the Board upon the adjustments of assets and liabilities and of rights, claims, liabilities and obligations referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c), or any of them, the report to be filed with the Board within such time as the Board may from time to time allow, and the Board shall consider the report and may hear such representations with respect thereto as it may see fit and may adopt, vary or amend the report or refer it back to the referee or referees for further consideration, and the order of the Board adopting the report or varying or amending the report is final and conclusive and not open to question or appeal and is binding upon all municipalities and local boards affected thereby; (e) fix the remuneration and expenses of the referee or referees and declare by whom and in what manner the remuneration and expenses shall be paid; (f) subject to section 20, require the transfer of real property from any local board to the municipality or a local board thereof, and take any such transfer into consideration in the adjustments of assets and liabilities; (g) vest real property of any local board in the municipality or a local board thereof and take any such vesting into consideration in the adjustments of assets and liabilities; (h) make all such provisions for the composition of the council and any local boards, the fixing of days for nominations, either before or subsequent to the day on which the annexation becomes effective, the appointment of returning officers, the holding of elections, the qualifications of candidates and electors, the preparation of first polling lists and assessment rolls, the fixing of days for first meetings of the council and any local boards, and for such other matters as it may consider necessary to provide for the effective administration of the enlarged municipality or of any local board thereof; (i) direct the name that shall be borne by the enlarged municipality; (j) where the holder of an operating licence under the Public Vehicles Act is adversely affected by the annexation, (i) authorize the municipality to pay to the holder of the licence in respect of such adverse effect the amount of compensation agreed upon, or (ii) direct what compensation, if any, shall be paid by the municipality to the holder of the licence in respect of such adverse effect; (k) where by reason of any annexation order made under this section the taxable assessment of a locality as defined in the Education Act is reduced by not less than 15 per cent as shown by the last returned assessment roll prior to the effective date of such annexation, authorize and direct the payment to a school board thereof by the annexing municipality or a school board thereof, to relieve such school board from any undue burden by reason of the loss of such assessment, of compensating grants during a period of not more than five years after the effective date of the annexation in such amounts and manner as may be agreed upon between the municipality and the school boards and approved by the Municipal Board or, failing agreement, as the Municipal Board considers equitable; (l) where by reason of annexation orders made under this section within any three-year period the taxable assessment of a locality as defined in the Education Act is reduced by not less than a total of 15 per cent as shown by the last returned assessment rolls prior to the effective date of each of such annexations, and no order has been made under clause (k), authorize and direct the payment to a school board therein by the annexing municipality or a school board thereof, to relieve such school board from any undue burden by reason of the loss of such assessment, of compensating grants during a period of not more than five years after the effective date of the last annexation in such amounts and manner as may be agreed upon between the municipality and the school boards and approved by the Municipal Board or, failing agreement, as the Municipal Board considers equitable after a public hearing in each case; (m) do or cause to be done all such other matters, acts, deeds and things as may be necessary or incidental to the carrying out of the annexation provided for in such order. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 14 (7); 1997, c. 5, s. 41; 1997, c. 29, s. 23. Urban service areas (8)The Municipal Board may, by any order made pursuant to an application under this section or a predecessor thereof or by subsequent order or orders, define urban services and cost of urban services and establish and, after establishment, alter one or more urban service areas within the municipality as enlarged by an annexation and determine the manner in which and upon what land or rateable property the cost of providing urban services is to be levied and raised by the municipality, and determine the manner in which and upon what land or rateable property the liabilities, in respect of urban services of any annexed locality or area as it existed prior to the annexation, shall be discharged by the imposition of rates in an urban service area. Effect of order on exemptions (9)An order under subsection (8) does not affect any exemption or partial exemption from taxation or rates or provision therefor in any general or special Act. Farm lands (10)Section 21 of the Assessment Act applies to land situated in an urban service area with respect to taxation or rates levied under or by virtue of an order made under this subsection as if the urban service area were the whole municipality. Determination of compensating grants by Board (11)Where compensating grants are to be determined by the Municipal Board under clause (7) (k), the determination shall not be made until after one complete fiscal year of the municipality has elapsed following the date of the annexation. Municipal Board may make rules, etc. (12)The Municipal Board may make such rules and regulations and issue such orders and directions in respect of any matter not specifically provided for in this section as it considers necessary or desirable in connection with any such annexation and every such rule, regulation, order and direction is valid and binding upon all municipalities and local boards interested in or affected thereby. Provisions of this section to prevail (13)The powers conferred upon the Municipal Board by this section may be exercised at any time or times despite this Act or any other special or general Act and, in the event of any conflict between this section and the other provisions of this Act or any other special or general Act, this section prevails. Decision granting annexation (14)Section 95 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act does not apply to a decision of the Municipal Board providing for an annexation or refusing an application for an annexation and such decision, (a) shall be in writing; (b) shall identify the area to be annexed; and (c) shall fix the date when the annexation shall be effective, and a copy of the decision shall be sent by the secretary of the Board by registered mail to the clerk of every municipality, including every county, affected by the decision, and to such other persons as the Board may direct. Notice of objection (15)No order shall be made under subsection (2) until the expiration of twenty-eight days after the mailing of the copies of the decision under subsection (14) and, within such period of twenty-eight days, notice of objection to the decision may be filed with the Clerk of the Executive Council. Idem (16)For the purposes of subsection (15), the notice of objection means an objection in writing, giving reasons therefor, that, according to the certificate of the clerk of the municipality, is signed by not less than 10 per cent of the persons qualified to vote who are resident in, (a) the municipality that has applied for the order; or (b) the area that by the decision is to be annexed to the applicant municipality, and includes, where there are no persons qualified to vote who are resident in the area to be annexed, an objection in writing, giving reasons therefor, authorized by resolution of a school board having jurisdiction in the locality in which such area is situated. Withdrawal of objection (17)An objection filed under subsection (15) may be withdrawn by the filing with the Clerk of the Executive Council, at any time before the Lieutenant Governor in Council has made an order under subsection (18), of a notice in writing of such withdrawal signed by one-third or more of the objectors if the then remaining objectors constitute not more than 10 per cent of the persons who were entitled to sign the objection under subsection (16), or, where the objection was authorized by a school board, of a certified copy of a resolution repealing the authorizing resolution. Powers of Lieutenant Governor in Council (18)Where an objection is filed in accordance with subsections (15) and (16) and is not withdrawn, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may by order, (a) confirm the decision of the Municipal Board; or (b) require the Municipal Board to hold a new public hearing of the annexation application before such members of the Board as the Lieutenant Governor in Council may designate. Finality of decision (19)The decision of the Municipal Board, (a) where no objection is filed in accordance with subsections (15) and (16) or where the objections thereto are withdrawn in accordance with subsection (17); or (b) when confirmed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council; or (c) after a new public hearing ordered by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, is final and not open to appeal, and the Board may thereupon make an order under subsection (2). Application of O.M.B.A. (20)Nothing in this section affects the application of section 96 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act. Adding parts to municipality in a county or another territorial district (21)Where an area becomes part of a local municipality in a county or another territorial district, it thereafter forms part of that county or territorial district, except for the purpose of representation in the Assembly. Registration of order (22)When an order is made under subsection (2), it shall be registered as required by section 68 of the Registry Act as soon as practicable after the effective date of the order, (a) where the order is made upon the application of the Minister, by the Minister; and (b) where the order is made upon the application of a municipality, by the clerk of the municipality.

Effect of redemption 6. Where a debenture is redeemed on a date prior to maturity, such redemption does not affect the validity of any by-law by which special assessments are imposed or instalments thereof levied, the validity of such special assessments or levies, or the powers of the council to continue to levy and collect such special assessments and instalments thereof.

            "content": "195.(1)In this section, “highway” includes “street” as defined in the Local Improvement Act. By-law may fix future date for widening, etc. (2)A by-law of the council of a local municipality for establishing or laying out, or for extending, widening or diverting, a highway or part of a highway may provide that the corporation shall not enter immediately on the land required to be taken or proceed to carry out the work but that the same shall be deferred until a day named therein not less than three and not more than ten years after the date of the passing of the by-law. Entry deferred accordingly (3)Subject to subsection (8), the corporation shall not enter on any land required to be taken before the day named in such by-law unless by leave of a judge of the Ontario Court (General Division) or by order of the Municipal Board made as hereinafter provided. By-law not to be repealed except with leave of Municipal Board (4)The by-law shall be binding upon the corporation and shall not be repealed or altered except with leave of the Municipal Board, such leave to be granted the corporation only for exceptional reasons not apparent or existing when the by-law was passed and after hearing the owners of the lands proposed to be taken and on such terms as the Board may determine in regard to the revesting of the land taken and the payment to each owner of the damages, if any, sustained by the owner in consequence of the passing of the by-law or of so much of the by-law as is proposed to be altered and the owner’s costs. Registration of plan in advance (5)Where the council proposes to pass a by-law under this section, it may register in the proper land registry office a draft plan of the contemplated work with any supplementary memorandum that may be needed to show its substantial features and to furnish adequate local description to comply with the Registry Act and the land registrar shall enter the same on the abstract index for each parcel of land required to be taken; but, if the by-law is not passed within six months after such registration, the registration shall be deemed of no effect and the corporation shall forthwith cause a certificate signed by the mayor or reeve and clerk and sealed with the corporation’s seal, stating that no by-law was passed, to be registered in like manner in the land registry office. Land taken shall vest at once in corporation on conditions (6)After the passing of the by-law and subject to any order made by the Municipal Board under subsection (4), the land required to be taken for the work shall be deemed to be vested in the corporation for the purposes of a highway subject to the right of the owner or the owner’s assigns to remain in the possession and enjoyment thereof without impeachment of waste either wanton or permissive until entry by the corporation as aforesaid and to utilize the land and to erect buildings thereon during the occupancy (subject to subsections (13) to (17) as to compensation in respect of such buildings). Assessment of land when vested (7)After the land is vested in the corporation, it shall for all purposes of assessment and taxation, whether under such by-law or otherwise, be deemed to be a component part of the highway; but, where a building stands partly on land taken for the work and partly on adjoining land, it shall be assessed on the assessment roll of the municipality in the same manner as if it stood entirely on such adjoining land. Application by corporation to Municipal Board to further defer entry (8)Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Municipal Board upon application made by the corporation before the day fixed for entry by the by-law that in view of financial conditions it is desirable that the day fixed for entry by the by-law should be further deferred, the Municipal Board may further defer the time for entry by the corporation on the land until a day not less than one year and not more than three years after the day fixed for entry by the by-law, but so that the total time for which entry is deferred by the by-law and the order of the Municipal Board shall not exceed ten years, upon such terms and conditions as the Board considers proper, and upon such order being made the day fixed by the Municipal Board as the day for entry shall thereafter be deemed to be the day fixed in the by-law for entry. Corporation to enter at date named (9)At the date named in the by-law for entry, it is the duty of the corporation to enter and proceed with diligence and dispatch to remove all buildings and obstructions from the land taken for the work and to put it in fit and proper condition and make it available for use as a highway. Subsequent by-law for undertaking work as a local improvement (10)The by-law may be passed without regard to the Local Improvement Act and shall express the intention of the council as to the corporation’s portion of the cost thereunder, and the council may thereafter by a majority vote pass a by-law for undertaking the work as a local improvement and such by-law has the same force and effect as if passed under section 8 of the Local Improvement Act and that Act applies thereafter to such work with necessary modifications and the owners of the lots liable to be specially assessed thereunder have all the rights and remedies in relation thereto that are given them by such Act so far as they are not inconsistent with the other provisions of this section, but the Municipal Board has no power under section 6 or 8 of such Act, either by making an order or by withholding its approval to prevent the due carrying out of the work. Compensation, when payable (11)Except as may be otherwise ordered by the Municipal Board under subsection (18), compensation payable under this section does not become payable until the day fixed in the by-law for entry. Limitations as to compensation (12)The compensation shall be limited to, (a) the market value of the land itself exclusive of and without regard to any buildings or improvements thereon; (b) the value of the buildings and improvements; (c) damages occasioned by disturbance to any business established previous to the passing of the by-law to which the general principles of compensation apply; (d) damages to land, buildings and improvements injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this section. Definition (13)In subsections (14) and (15), “land” means the land itself exclusive of and without regard to any buildings or improvements thereon. Fixing compensation for land apart from buildings (14)Although entry is deferred, the corporation or the owner may proceed at once after the passing of the by-law to determine or have determined the compensation, if any, payable hereunder in respect of any land. Value (15)The value of the land shall be fixed as of the date of the registration of the draft plan or, if no plan is registered, as of the date of the passing of the by-law. Fixing compensation for buildings (16)Compensation shall be allowed in respect of buildings and improvements as they may exist at the date fixed for entry. As to buildings erected after passing of by-law (17)In respect to buildings or improvements erected or made after the date of the registration of the draft plan of the work or, if no plan is registered, after the date of the passing of the by-law, the compensation or damages shall be allowed and payable to the extent only of three-quarters of the proper cost of a structure one storey in height of such temporary character, conformable to the existing building by-laws and regulations, as may be reasonable in view of the limited time that is to elapse before entry. Relief in special cases (18)The Municipal Board may make an order at any time granting relief, (a) where part of an owner’s lot is taken for the work and special circumstances exist in the matter of the location, size or shape of the lot that render it inequitable and unjust that the compensation to be allowed for buildings or improvements to be thereafter erected thereon should be limited as provided in subsections (16) and (17); and (b) where the work is deferred until a day more than five years after the date of the passing of the by-law and the whole of the owner’s lot is taken or so much of it as to render the remainder, by reason of its size or shape, unfit for building purposes. Idem (19)The Board may, (a) in relation to clause (18) (a), approve of plans and specifications for appropriate buildings or improvements and fix the basis of compensation to be made therefor; (b) in relation to clause (18) (b), direct the corporation to enter and make compensation to the owner at an earlier day than the day named in the by-law or to make an immediate or periodical payment to the owner to compensate for the delay; or (c) in relation to either clause (18) (a) or (b), make such further or other order as may be required to afford due compensation to the owner for the exceptional and peculiar damage the owner would suffer by reason of the special circumstances affecting the lot. Temporary advances (20)The council may agree with any bank or person for temporary advances to meet any costs or liabilities incurred under the by-law prior to the completion of the work.

corporation only for exceptional reasons not apparent or existing when the by-law was passed and after hearing the owners of the lands proposed to be taken and on such terms as the Board may determine in regard to the revesting of the land taken and the payment to each owner of the damages, if any, sustained by the owner in consequence of the passing of the by-law or of so much of the by-law as is proposed to be altered and the owner’s costs.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Registration of plan in advance</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(5)Where the council proposes to pass a by-law under this section, it may register in the proper land registry office a draft plan of the contemplated work with any supplementary memorandum that may be needed to show its substantial features and to furnish adequate local description to comply with the <i>Registry Act</i> and the land registrar shall enter the same on the abstract index for each parcel of land required to be taken; but, if the by-law is not passed within six months after such registration, the registration shall be deemed of no effect and the corporation shall forthwith cause a certificate signed by the mayor or reeve and clerk and sealed with the corporation’s seal, stating that no by-law was passed, to be registered in like manner in the land registry office.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Land taken shall vest at once in corporation on conditions</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(6)After the passing of the by-law and subject to any order made by the Municipal Board under subsection (4), the land required to be taken for the work shall be deemed to be vested in the corporation for the purposes of a highway subject to the right of the owner or the owner’s assigns to remain in the possession and enjoyment thereof without impeachment of waste either wanton or permissive until entry by the corporation as aforesaid and to utilize the land and to erect buildings thereon during the occupancy (subject to subsections (13) to (17) as to compensation in respect of such buildings).</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Assessment of land when vested</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(7)After the land is vested in the corporation, it shall for all purposes of assessment and taxation, whether under such by-law or otherwise, be deemed to be a component part of the highway; but, where a building stands partly on land taken for the work and partly on adjoining land, it shall be assessed on the assessment roll of the municipality in the same manner as if it stood entirely on such adjoining land.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Application by corporation to Municipal Board to further defer entry</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(8)Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Municipal Board upon application made by the corporation before the day fixed for entry by the by-law that in view of financial conditions it is desirable that the day fixed for entry by the by-law should be further deferred, the Municipal Board may further defer the time for entry by the corporation on the land until a day not less than one year and not more than three years after the day fixed for entry by the by-law, but so that the total time for which entry is deferred by the by-law and the order of the Municipal Board shall not exceed ten years, upon such terms and conditions as the Board considers proper, and upon such order being made the day fixed by the Municipal Board as the day for entry shall thereafter be deemed to be the day fixed in the by-law for entry.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Corporation to enter at date named</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(9)At the date named in the by-law for entry, it is the duty of the corporation to enter and proceed with diligence and dispatch to remove all buildings and obstructions from the land taken for the work and to put it in fit and proper condition and make it available for use as a highway.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Subsequent by-law for undertaking work as a local improvement</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(10)The by-law may be passed without regard to the <i>Local Improvement Act</i> and shall express the intention of the council as to the corporation’s portion of the cost thereunder, and the council may thereafter by a majority vote pass a by-law for undertaking the work as a local improvement and such by-law has the same force and effect as if passed under section 8 of the <i>Local Improvement Act</i> and that Act applies thereafter to such work with necessary modifications and the owners of the lots liable to be specially assessed thereunder have all the rights and remedies in relation thereto that are given them by such Act so far as they are not inconsistent with the other provisions of this section, but the Municipal Board has no power under section 6 or 8 of such Act, either by making an order or by withholding its approval to prevent the due carrying out of the work.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Compensation, when payable</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(11)Except as may be otherwise ordered by the Municipal Board under subsection (18), compensation payable under this section does not become payable until the day fixed in the by-law for entry.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Limitations as to compensation</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(12)The compensation shall be limited to,</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(a) the market value of the land itself exclusive of and without regard to any buildings or improvements thereon;</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(b) the value of the buildings and improvements;</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(c) damages occasioned by disturbance to any business established previous to the passing of the by-law to which the general principles of compensation apply;</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(d) damages to land, buildings and improvements injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this section.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Definition</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(13)In subsections (14) and (15),</p> <p class=\"firstdef-e\">“land” means the land itself exclusive of and without regard to any buildings or improvements thereon.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Fixing compensation for land apart from buildings</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(14)Although entry is deferred, the corporation or the owner may proceed at once after the passing of the by-law to determine or have determined the compensation, if any, payable hereunder in respect of any land.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Value</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(15)The value of the land shall be fixed as of the date of the registration of the draft plan or, if no plan is registered, as of the date of the passing of the by-law.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Fixing compensation for buildings</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(16)Compensation shall be allowed in respect of buildings and improvements as they may exist at the date fixed for entry.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>As to buildings erected after passing of by-law</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(17)In respect to buildings or improvements erected or made after the date of the registration of the draft plan of the work or, if no plan is registered, after the date of the passing of the by-law, the compensation or damages shall be allowed and payable to the extent only of three-quarters of the proper cost of a structure one storey in height of such temporary character, conformable to the existing building by-laws and regulations, as may be reasonable in view of the limited time that is to elapse before entry.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Relief in special cases</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(18)The Municipal Board may make an order at any time granting relief,</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(a) where part of an owner’s lot is taken for the work and special circumstances exist in the matter of the location, size or shape of the lot that render it inequitable and unjust that the compensation to be allowed for buildings or improvements to be thereafter erected thereon should be limited as provided in subsections (16) and (17); and</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(b) where the work is deferred until a day more than five years after the date of the passing of the by-law and the whole of the owner’s lot is taken or so much of it as to render the remainder, by reason of its size or shape, unfit for building purposes.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Idem</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(19)The Board may,</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(a) in relation to clause (18) (a), approve of plans and specifications for appropriate buildings or improvements and fix the basis of compensation to be made therefor;</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(b) in relation to clause (18) (b), direct the corporation to enter and make compensation to the owner at an earlier day than the day named in the by-law or to make an immediate or periodical payment to the owner to compensate for the delay; or</p> <p class=\"clause-e\">(c) in relation to either clause (18) (a) or (b), make such further or other order as may be required to afford due compensation to the owner for the exceptional and peculiar damage the owner would suffer by reason of the special circumstances affecting the lot.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Temporary advances</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(20)The council may agree with any bank or person for temporary advances to meet any costs or liabilities incurred under the by-law prior to the completion of the work.

Maximum building line (4)The building line fixed by the by-law shall not be distant more than six metres from the limit of the highway. Exceptions (5)Despite subsection (4), for the purpose of carrying out an official plan in effect under the Planning Act or for the purpose of improving the appearance or utility of the highway, the Municipal Board may authorize the establishment of the building line at a distance greater than six metres from the limit of the highway in respect of any part or parts of the highway. Building line need not be uniform (6)The distance between the limit of the highway and the building line need not be the same for all parts of the highway or part of a highway in respect of which the by-law is passed.

Compulsory acquisition of land (8)After the by-law has been passed and approved by the Municipal Board, (a) if three-quarters of the frontage measured along one limit of the highway between two streets intersecting the highway is clear of buildings, other than one-storey shop or building fronts, back to the building line; or (b) if, at any time after the expiration of ten years from the date of the by-law, a majority of the owners of the land fronting and abutting on one limit of the highway between two streets intersecting the highway so petition in writing, the municipality shall acquire the land fronting and abutting on that limit of the highway and lying between the two streets intersecting the highway and between the limit of the highway and the building line. Board may authorize delay (9)Although the conditions set out in clause (8) (a) have been fulfilled, the Municipal Board may from time to time authorize the municipality to delay its acquisition of the land in question, but no such authority shall be given so as to delay the acquisition beyond ten years from the date of the by-law. Conveyance to municipality when land clear (10)Where that part of the land of any owner lying between the limit of the highway and the building line is or becomes clear of buildings and the owner offers to convey that part to the municipality, the municipality shall accept the conveyance and is liable for compensation to the owner or the persons entitled thereto to the same extent as if the by-law had been passed to widen the highway. Limitation on compensation (11)In determining the compensation payable by the municipality for the taking of lands for the widening of a portion of a highway in respect of which a building line has been fixed under this section, the municipality is not liable to pay compensation for or in respect of any building erected in contravention of the by-law fixing the building line.

R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (5-9). Exclusive jurisdiction (10)If a county has assumed the power for providing services or facilities for any part of a waste management system, no municipality under a similar or equivalent power and no person shall, within the participating local municipalities, provide services or facilities of the type authorized by the powers assumed by the county without the consent of the council of the county, which consent may be given upon such terms including the payment of compensation, as may be agreed upon. 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (4). Exemption (10.1)Despite subsection (10), a person may, without the consent of the council of the county, provide services and facilities for the collection or removal of waste from non-residential properties and residential properties containing more than five dwelling units. 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (5). Continuation of waste management services (11)Subsection (10) does not apply to prevent any person or municipality which does not form part of the county for municipal purposes or which is not a participating municipality from providing a waste management service or facility if that waste management service or facility was being lawfully provided on the effective date of the by-law, so long as that waste management service or facility continues to be used for that purpose. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (11); 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (6). Appeal to O.M.B. where disagreement or consent denied (12)If consent is refused under subsection (10) or the applicant and the council of the county fail to agree on the terms and conditions related to the consent, the applicant may appeal to the Municipal Board which shall hear and determine the matter. Terms (13)The Municipal Board may impose such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate and the decision of the Municipal Board is final. No appeal (14)Section 95 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act does not apply to a decision made under subsection (13). Transfer of assets, liabilities (15)All rights and obligations and all assets and liabilities of a participating local municipality or local board thereof pertaining to or primarily used in connection with the waste management powers assumed by the county are vested in the county and financial adjustments, calculated in accordance with such criteria as may be prescribed, shall be made between the county and the participating local municipality or local board thereof. Assumption by county of certain debts (16)The county shall pay to the participating local municipality or local board thereof on or before the due date all amounts of principal and interest becoming due upon any outstanding debt of such participating local municipality or local board thereof in respect of the waste management powers assumed by the county. Interest on late payments (17)If the county fails to make any payment required under subsection (16) on or before the due date, the participating local municipality or local board may charge the county interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum, or such lower rate as the local municipality or local board determines, from such date until payment is made. Transfer of agreements to county (18)If a participating local municipality or local board thereof had entered into an agreement with another person or municipality in respect of the waste management power assumed by the county, the county shall be bound by the agreement and the participating local municipality or local board thereof is relieved of all liability under the agreement. Agreements respecting waste management (19)The council of the county may enter into agreements with any person or municipality for establishing, constructing, operating or managing, at their joint expense and for their joint benefit, any waste management service or facility that is within the jurisdiction of the council as a result of the passage of the by-law under subsection (2). Idem (20)Where the county has passed a by-law under subsection (2) to empower it to adopt a waste management plan, the council of the county may enter into agreements with any municipality for developing, at their joint expense and for their joint benefit, joint objectives and policies for the provision of waste management services or facilities. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (12-20). Collection of waste management rates (21)Despite section 366, the council of a county may by by-law provide for imposing on and collecting from participating local municipalities for which it is providing waste management services or facilities a waste management rate sufficient to pay the whole or such portion as the by-law may specify of the capital costs including debenture charges and expenditures for the establishment, maintenance and operation of the waste management services or facilities in the participating local municipalities and such rate may vary based on the volume, weight or class of waste or on any other basis the council of the county considers appropriate and specifies in the by-law. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (21); 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (7); 1997, c. 5, s. 50 (1). Rates constitute debt of county (22)All rates under subsection (21) constitute a debt of the participating local municipality to the county and shall be payable at such times and in such amounts as may be specified by by-law of the council of the county. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (22). Payment and collection of rates (23)Despite section 366, the participating local municipality may, (a) pay the whole or part of the amount chargeable to it under this section out of its general funds; (b) pass by-laws for imposing a rate sufficient to recover the whole or part of the amount chargeable to it under this section in the same manner as by-laws under section 208.5 and clause 208.6 (2) (b); and (c) include the whole or any part of an amount chargeable to it under this section as part of the cost of an urban service within an urban service area established in the participating local municipality under any general or special Act. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (23); 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (8); 1997, c. 5, s. 50 (2). Designation of facilities (24)If under a by-law passed under subsection (2) a county has assumed the waste management power for providing services or facilities for any part of a waste management system, the council of the county may, for each participating local municipality, designate one or more of the services or facilities provided under that power for the management of waste or any class thereof of that municipality. Restriction (24.1)Where a designation has been made, a participating local municipality shall not utilize any services or facilities except the services or facilities that have been so designated for that local municipality. 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (9). Dispute resolution (25)If a dispute arises in respect of the financial adjustments or the vesting of assets, including a reserve fund, under subsection (15), or the transfer of agreements under subsection (18), the county, participating local municipality or local board affected may apply to the Municipal Board for a resolution of the dispute and the Municipal Board has power to hear and determine the matter and its decision is final. No appeal (26)Section 95 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act does not apply to a decision made under subsection (25). R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (25, 26).

R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 209 (27); 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (10). Arbitration (28)If a dispute arises as to whether a regulation under clause (27) (b) is being properly applied in any particular case, the county, an employee, a retired employee or a bargaining agent may, by notice in writing to the other affected parties, require the dispute be determined by an arbitrator agreed on by the affected parties and the decision of the arbitrator is final. Appointment by Minister (29)If the affected parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty days of a notice being given under subsection (28), the Minister may appoint the arbitrator. 1993, c. 20, s. 2 (11).",

A hectarage rate or rates on any or all of the lands designated under subsection (6), which rates may differ as between lands that will receive an immediate benefit and lands that will receive a deferred benefit. 4. Repealed: 1997, c. 5, s. 52. 5. A rate on that portion of the lands designated under subsection (6) that is connected to the sewage works based on the water rates or charges charged or chargeable in respect of such lands. 6.

Idem (12)The revenue from the sewer rate or water works rate imposed under subsection (2), if not required for payment of principal and interest due as specified in subsection (11), may be credited by the municipality to its general revenues. Sewer or water works rate for cost of existing works (13)Where in a local municipality there is land that has not or the owners or occupants of which have not been and are not assessable or taxed with respect to an existing sewage works or water works except in the same manner and to the same extent as all other owners or occupants of land within the municipality or within an area established under clause (e) of paragraph 58 of section 210 have been or are assessable or taxed and a sewer or water main forming part of such existing sewage works or water works is to be constructed by means of which an immediate benefit from the existing works accrues to the owners or occupants of such land, the council may, by by-law, provide for imposing upon the owners or occupants so benefited a sewer rate or water works rate sufficient to pay for such portion or percentage of the capital cost of the existing sewage works or water works as the by-law may specify.

Commutation (18)The council may by a general by-law or by a by-law applicable to the particular work prescribe terms and conditions upon which persons whose lands are liable to a sewer rate or water works rate imposed by a by-law under this section may commute such rate for a payment in cash. Commutation continued (19)If a council has commuted a sewer rate or water works rate under subsection (18) and subsequently amends the rating by-law establishing the rate to which the commutation applies, the council shall in its amendment provide for the application of the same commutation to the amended rates. Sewage service rate (20)The council of a local municipality may by by-law provide for imposing upon owners or occupants of land who use sewage works a sewage service rate. Idem (21)A sewage service rate may be imposed under subsection (20) even if, (a) a sewer rate has also been imposed with respect to the capital cost of the same works; and (b) the work with respect to which it is imposed was constructed under the Local Improvement Act or any other general or special Act. Sewage service rate structure (22)The council of a local municipality for the purposes of subsection (20) may by by-law establish a sewage service rate structure upon which sewage service rates shall be based and calculated and, in establishing the rate structure, the council shall have regard to differentiating between classes of users, nature, volume and frequency of use and all other relevant matters to ensure that sewage service rates are imposed upon a basis that is equitable and just, and where the sewage service rate is based on the water rate it shall be collectable in the same manner as water rates. Equivalent charges, sewers (23)If a council does not impose a sewage service rate under subsection (20), it may by by-law include as part of a sewer rate imposed under subsection (2) or (13) a charge which could otherwise be imposed as a sewage service rate.

Liability (1.1)In case of default, the corporation, subject to the Negligence Act, is liable for all damages any person sustains because of the default. Defence (1.2)The corporation is not liable under subsection (1) or (1.1) for failing to keep a highway or bridge in a reasonable state of repair if it did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know about the state of repair of the highway or bridge. Same (1.3)The corporation is not liable under subsection (1) or (1.1) for failing to keep a highway or bridge in a reasonable state of repair if it took reasonable steps to prevent the default from arising. Same (1.4)The corporation is not liable under subsection (1) or (1.1) for failing to keep a highway or bridge in a reasonable state of repair if, at the time the cause of action arises, (a) minimum standards established under subsection (1.5) apply, (i) to the highway or bridge, and (ii) to the alleged default; and (b) those standards have been met. Regulation (1.5)The Minister of Transportation may, by regulation, establish minimum standards of repair for, (a) highways and roads; (b) classes of highways and roads; (c) bridges; (d) classes of bridges. Same (1.6)The minimum standards may be general or particular in their application. Application extended to upper tier (1.7)A regulation made under subsection (1.5) also applies to regional, district and metropolitan municipalities and the County of Oxford. Adoption by reference (1.8)A regulation made under subsection (1.5) may adopt by reference, in whole or in part, with such changes as the Minister of Transportation considers necessary, any code, standard or guideline, as it reads at the time the regulation is made or as amended from time to time, whether before or after the regulation is made. 1996, c. 32, s. 54 (1). Limitation of actions (2)No action shall be brought against a corporation for the recovery of damages occasioned by such default, whether the want of a reasonable state of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance, after the expiration of three months from the time when the damages were sustained. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s. 284 (2); 1996, c. 32, s. 54 (2). Insufficiency of fences, etc. (3)No action shall be brought against a corporation for the recovery of damages caused by the presence or absence or insufficiency of any wall, fence, guard rail, railing or barrier, or caused by or on account of any construction, obstruction or erection or any situation, arrangement, or disposition of any earth, rock, tree or other material or object adjacent to or in, along or upon any highway or any part thereof not within the travelled portion of such highway. Snow or ice on sidewalks (4)Except in case of gross negligence, a corporation is not liable for a personal injury caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk. Notice of action (5)No action shall be brought for the recovery of the damages mentioned in subsection (1) unless notice in writing of the claim and of the injury complained of has been served upon or sent by registered mail to the head or the clerk of the corporation, in the case of a county or township within ten days, and in the case of an urban municipality within seven days, after the happening of the injury, nor unless, where the claim is against two or more corporations jointly liable for the repair of the highway or bridge, the prescribed notice was given to each of them within the prescribed time. When failure to give notice of claim is not a bar to action (6)In the case of the death of the person injured, failure to give notice is not a bar to the action and, except where the injury was caused by snow or ice upon a sidewalk, failure to give or insufficiency of the notice is not a bar to the action, if the court or judge before whom the action is tried is of the opinion that the corporation in its defence was not prejudiced by the want or insufficiency of the notice and that to bar the action would be an injustice, even if reasonable excuse for the want or insufficiency of the notice is not established. To what roads applicable (7)This section does not apply to a road, street or highway laid out or to a bridge built by a private person or by a body corporate until it is established by by-law of the council or otherwise assumed for public use by the corporation. When corporation not responsible for acts of others (8)Nothing in this section imposes upon a corporation any obligation or liability in respect of any act or omission of any person acting in the exercise of any power or authority conferred upon that person by law, and over which the corporation had no control, unless the corporation was a party to the act or omission, or the authority under which such person acted was a by-law, resolution or licence of its council. When corporation not liable for damages (9)A corporation is not liable for damages under this section unless the person claiming the damages has suffered by reason of the default of the corporation a particular loss or damage beyond what is suffered by that person in common with all other persons affected by the want of repair. Relief from obligation to rebuild (10)Where a bridge that it is the duty of a corporation to repair is destroyed or so damaged that it is necessary to rebuild it, the Municipal Board may, upon the application of the corporation, relieve it from the obligation to rebuild the bridge, if the Board is satisfied that it is no longer required for the public convenience or that the rebuilding of it would entail a larger expenditure than would be reasonable having regard to the use that would be made of the bridge if it were rebuilt. Conditions of granting relief (11)The relief may be granted on such terms and conditions as the Board considers just, and such notice of the application shall be given as the Board may direct.

(2), (3)Repealed: 1998, c. 3, s. 21 (2). Application to lower-tiers (4)A by-law under subsection (1) of an upper-tier municipality also applies with respect to the taxes of its lower-tier municipalities. 1997, c. 5, s. 55. By-law requirements (5)A by-law under subsection (1) is subject to the following: 1. The first year in which a 1998 assessment-related tax increase or decrease is phased-in must be the 1998 taxation year and the last year must be the 2005 taxation year or an earlier taxation year. 2. If the by-law is phasing in a 1998 assessment-related tax increase, the following adjustments shall be made to taxes for a property for a taxation year, i. the 1998 assessment-related tax increase shall be subtracted from the taxes, ii. the amounts phased-in in each of the previous years shall be added to the taxes, and iii. the amount to be phased-in in the current taxation year shall be added to the taxes. 3. If the by-law is phasing in a 1998 assessment-related tax decrease, the following adjustments shall be made to taxes for a property for a taxation year, i. the 1998 assessment-related tax decrease shall be added to the taxes, ii. the amounts phased-in in each of the previous years shall be subtracted from the taxes, and iii. the amount to be phased-in in the current taxation year shall be subtracted from the taxes. 4. The amount to be phased-in in a year, other than 1998, must be the same or less than the amount phased-in in the previous year. 5. The amount phased-in in the last year in which an 1998 assessment-related tax increase or decrease is phased-in plus the total of the amounts phased-in in the previous years must equal the 1998 assessment-related tax increase or decrease. 6. The by-law must set out, for each property with respect to which the by-law applies, the 1998 assessment-related tax increase or decrease. 7. The by-law may treat different property classes differently and it may provide for no phase-ins for some classes. However, if the by-law applies to property in a property class it must apply to all properties in the property class. 8. For each property class for each year, the adjustments made under the by-law must not affect the total taxes for municipal and school purposes on the land in the municipality that is in the property class and that is rateable for municipal purposes. For the purposes of this paragraph, the residential/farm property class, the farmlands property class and the managed forests property class prescribed under the Assessment Act shall be deemed to be a single property class. 1997, c. 5, s. 55; 1997, c. 29, s. 42 (2); 1998, c. 3, s. 21 (3). If change in use, character, classification of land (6)If there has been a change in the use or character of any land or in its classification under the Assessment Act that, in the opinion of the council of the municipality, makes a phase-in or the continuation of a phase-in in respect of such land inappropriate, the council may in the by-law under subsection (1) or in another by-law exclude such land from the application of the phase-in. Improvements replaced after scheme begins (7)If an improvement to a property is substantially destroyed before a by-law under subsection (1) is passed and, before the end of the last year in which an increase or decrease is phased in, the improvement is replaced, the council of the municipality may amend the by-law under subsection (1) so that the by-law applies to the property as though the improvement had not been substantially destroyed. Same (8)Subsection (7) does not apply with respect to an improvement if the destruction of the improvement is by the owner, is permitted by the owner or is done by a person who had a right to destroy the improvement. 1997, c. 5, s. 55. Sharing so that no surplus or shortfall (9)The council of an upper-tier municipality that passes a by-law under subsection (1) shall pass a by-law requiring adjustments between the upper-tier municipality and the lower-tier municipalities so that neither the upper-tier municipality nor any lower-tier municipality has a surplus or shortfall as a result of the phase-in of 1998 assessment-related tax increases or decreases. 1997, c. 29, s. 42 (3). Information on tax bill (10)A notice of demand of taxes payable in respect of which there is a phase-in shall indicate the amount of taxes that would have been payable without the phase-in, the amount of taxes that are payable, and the difference. 1997, c. 5, s. 55. Application to payments in lieu of taxes (11)This section applies with respect to payments in lieu of taxes, other than an amount referred to in subparagraph ii of paragraph 24 of subsection 3 (1) of the Assessment Act or an amount received under section 157 or subsection 158 (4) of this Act, as though they were taxes. However, a by-law under subsection (1) may provide that it does not apply with respect to payments in lieu of taxes. 1998, c. 3, s. 21 (4); 1998, c. 33, s. 18 (2). Taxes for school purposes (12)No phase-in of a 1998 assessment-related tax increase or decrease under this section affects the amount a local municipality is required to pay a school board. 1997, c. 29, s. 42 (4). Certain changes in 1998 assessment (13)The following apply if the assessment of a property for 1998 changes as a result of a complaint or appeal under section 40 or 46 of the Assessment Act: 1. The 1998 assessment-related tax increase or decrease for the property shall be redetermined under section 372.1, subject to paragraph 2, using the new assessment for the property. 2.

(“année précédente”) 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Tax increase to be phased in (3) If the total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the first taxation year for an eligible property, but for the application of this section, exceed its total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year, the maximum amount of the tax increase to be phased in is the amount of the difference. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Tax decrease to be phased in (4) If the total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year for an eligible property exceed its total taxes for municipal and school purposes for the first taxation year, but for the application of this section, the maximum amount of the tax decrease to be phased in is the amount of the difference. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Amounts to be phased in in 2001 and subsequent years (5) For properties subject to Part XXII.3 and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), (a) if the preceding year is 2000, the taxes for municipal and school purposes for that year shall be determined under subsection 447.65 (2); or (b) if the preceding year is after 2000, the taxes for municipal and school purposes for that year shall be determined under subsection 447.68 (2). 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Same (6) For properties that are not subject to Part XXII.3 and for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), the taxes for municipal and school purposes for the preceding year shall be determined as follows: 1. Determine the taxes for municipal and school purposes that were levied on the property in the year. 2. If a supplementary assessment or change in classification was made under section 34 of the Assessment Act during that year or if an assessment or change in classification could have been made under section 34 of that Act and the appropriate change is made to the assessment roll for taxation in the first taxation year, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the increase in the assessment or change in classification, as the case may be, had applied to the property for all of the year. 3. If the council of a municipality cancels, reduces or refunds taxes under section 442 for the year on an application under clause 442 (1) (a), (c), (d) or (f) or under section 443 for the year, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the event that caused the cancellation, reduction or refund had occurred on January 1 of that year. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Application to lower-tiers (7) A by-law under subsection (1) of an upper-tier municipality also applies with respect to the taxes of its lower-tier municipalities. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Copy (8) An upper-tier municipality shall provide a copy of the by-law under subsection (1) to each lower-tier municipality as soon as is practicable. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. By-law requirements (9) A by-law under subsection (1) is subject to the following: 1. The by-law may apply to the first taxation year and up to the next seven taxation years. 2. The by-law may replace a by-law made under section 372 or this section so long as the first-mentioned by-law applies for at least the same number of years as remains outstanding under the by-law made under section 372 or this section. 3. The by-law may modify the phase-in on individual properties subject to a phase-in under a by-law made under section 372 or this section in order to reflect tax increases or decreases determined under subsection (3) or (4). 4. The amount to be phased in in a year, other than in the first taxation year, must be the same or less than the amount phased in in the previous year. 5. The amount phased in in the last year in which a tax increase or decrease is phased in plus the total amounts phased in in the previous years must equal the tax increase or decrease for each property as determined under subsection (3) or (4). 6. The by-law may treat different property classes differently and it may provide for no phase-ins for some classes but if the by-law applies to property in a property class it must apply to all properties in the property class. 7. For the purposes of paragraph 6, the residential/farm property class, the farmlands property class and the managed forests property class shall be treated as a single property class. 8. In the first taxation year, the amounts recovered from all properties in the property class whose tax decreases are being phased in shall not exceed the revenues foregone from all properties in the property class whose tax increases are being phased-in for the municipality referred to in subsection (1). 9. The by-law may provide for a threshold amount in each taxation year, determined in dollars or as a percentage. 10. For the purposes of paragraph 9, the threshold amount for eligible properties in a property class in the municipality to which subsection (3) applies may be different from the threshold amount for eligible properties in the property class in the municipality to which subsection (4) applies. 11. If an assessment is made for a property under subsection 32 (2) or 33 (1) of the Assessment Act in or after the first taxation year but the assessment applies to a year prior to the first taxation year, i. the by-law made under subsection (1) shall apply to the property, and ii. the taxes for municipal and school purposes on the property shall be recalculated for the first taxation year and for any subsequent taxation year that is subject to the by-law under subsection (1). 2000, c. 25, s. 27. If change in use, character, classification of property (10) If there has been a change in the use or character of any eligible property or in its classification under the Assessment Act that, in the opinion of the council of the municipality, makes a phase-in or the continuation of a phase-in in respect of the property inappropriate, the council may in the by-law under subsection (1) or in another by-law exclude such property from the application of the phase-in. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Improvements replaced after scheme begins (11) If an improvement to an eligible property is substantially destroyed before a by-law under subsection (1) is passed and, before the end of the last year in which a tax increase or decrease is phased in, the improvement is replaced, the council of the municipality may amend the by-law under subsection (1) so that the by-law applies to the property as though the improvement had not been substantially destroyed. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Same (12) Subsection (11) does not apply with respect to an improvement if the destruction of the improvement is by the owner, is permitted by the owner or is done by a person who had a right to destroy the improvement. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. No lower tier surplus or shortfall (13) The council of an upper-tier municipality shall, in a by-law under subsection (1), provide that adjustments shall be made between the upper-tier municipality and lower-tier municipalities so that no lower-tier municipality has a surplus or shortfall as a result of the phase-in of the tax increases or decreases. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Upper-tier shortfall (14) If the upper-tier municipality experiences a shortfall as a result of the application of subsection (13), the by-law made under subsection (1) shall provide that any shortfall shall be shared by the upper-tier municipality and lower-tier municipalities in the same proportion as those municipalities share in the taxes levied on the property class for municipal purposes. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Information on tax bill (15) A notice of demand of taxes payable in respect of which there is a phase-in shall indicate the amount of taxes that would have been payable without the phase-in, the amount of taxes that are payable and the difference. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. List to be kept (16) The treasurer of the local municipality shall maintain a list of the tax increases or decreases for each eligible property to which the by-law under subsection (1) applies. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Application to payments in lieu of taxes (17) This section applies to payments in lieu of taxes, other than an amount referred to in subparagraph 24 ii of subsection 3 (1) of the Assessment Act or an amount received under section 157 or subsection 158 (4) of this Act, as though they were taxes but a by-law under subsection (1) may provide that it does not apply to payments in lieu of taxes. 2000, c. 25, s. 27. Taxes for school purposes (18) No phase-in of a tax increase or decrease under this section shall affect the amount a local municipality is required to pay a school board. 2000, c. 25, s. 27.

Crown property (2)A by-law under subsection (1) may contain provisions with respect to the payment of taxes by tenants of lands owned by the Crown or in which the Crown has an interest, in which case the by-law shall provide that, where any such tenant has been employed either within or outside the municipality by the same employer for not less than thirty days, such employer shall pay over to the treasurer or collector on demand out of any wages, salary or other remuneration due to such employee the amount then payable for taxes under the by-law and such payment relieves the employer from any liability to the employee for the amount so paid. Penalty for non-payment of taxes (3)The council may by by-law impose a percentage charge as a penalty for non-payment of taxes or any class or instalment thereof not exceeding 1 1/4 per cent on the first day of default and on the first day of each calendar month thereafter in which default continues, but not after the end of the year in which the taxes are levied. Idem (4)As an alternative to a by-law passed under subsection (3), the council may by by-law impose a percentage charge as a penalty for non-payment of taxes or any class or instalment thereof not exceeding 15 per cent per annum, or such lower rate as the council determines, from the date payment is due until it is made or until the 31st day of December of the year in which the taxes were levied, whichever is earlier. Discount or interest on payments in advance (5)The council may by by-law authorize the treasurer or collector to receive in any year payments on account of taxes for that year in advance of the day that may be fixed by by-law for the payment of any instalment of such taxes and, (a) to allow a discount on any taxes so paid in advance at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent per annum and may allow interest at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent per annum on account of taxes so paid in advance for any portion of the period for which no discount is allowed; or (b) to allow interest on taxes paid in advance of the day fixed by by-law for the payment of any instalment of such taxes at a rate not exceeding 12 per cent per annum, even if the taxes for such year have not been levied or that the assessment roll on which such taxes are to be fixed and levied has not been revised and certified by the Assessment Review Board when any such advance payment is made, and a by-law passed under this subsection remains in force from year to year until it is repealed or amended. Notice as to time and mode of payment (6)If a by-law is passed providing for payment by instalments or allowing any such discount or imposing any such additional percentage charge, a notice shall be given in accordance with section 392 on which shall be written or printed a concise statement of the time and manner of payment and of the discount allowed or the percentage charge imposed, if any, and at any time within twenty-one days or such longer period as the council may authorize after such notice has first been given, in accordance with section 392, any person may take advantage of the provisions of such by-law as to payment by instalments or with the discount allowed thereby, or without the additional percentage charge imposed thereby, as the case may be.

Eligible charities, property (2)For the purposes of this section, (a) a charity is eligible if it is a registered charity as defined in subsection 248 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) that has a registration number issued by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency; (b) a property is eligible if it is in one of the commercial classes or industrial classes, within the meaning of subsection 363 (20). 1998, c. 3, s. 27; 2000, c. 25, s. 32 (1). Program requirements (3)A tax rebate program under this section is subject to the following requirements: 1. The program must provide for a rebate for an eligible charity that pays taxes on eligible property it occupies. However, a rebate is not required if Part XXII.1 applies to the property. 2. The amount of a rebate required under paragraph 1 must be at least 40 per cent, or such other percentage as the Minister of Finance may prescribe, of the taxes paid by the eligible charity on the property it occupies. If the eligible charity is required to pay an amount under section 444.1 or 444.2, the amount of the rebate shall be the total of the amounts the charity paid under those sections. 3. Beginning in the 2001 taxation year, the program must provide that payment of one-half of the rebate must be made within 60 days after the receipt by the municipality of the application of the eligible charity for the rebate for the taxation year and the balance of the rebate must be paid within 120 days of the receipt of the application. 4. The program must permit the eligible charity to make an application for a rebate for a taxation year based on an estimate of the taxes payable by the eligible charity on the property it occupies. 5. Repealed: 2000, c. 25, s. 32 (3). 6. The program must provide for final adjustments, to be made after the taxes paid by the charity can be determined, in respect of differences between the estimated rebate paid by the municipality and the rebate to which the charity is entitled. 7. The program must require, as a condition of receiving a rebate for a year, that a charity repay any other municipality amounts by which the rebates the charity received for the year from that other municipality exceed the rebates from that other municipality to which the charity is entitled for the year. 8. The program must provide for a rebate for 1998 and subsequent years. 9. Despite paragraphs 3 and 4, the rebate for 1998 and the first instalment of the rebate for 1999 must be paid on or before October 31, 1998. 10. An application for a taxation year must be made after January 1 of the year and no later than the last day of February of the following year. 1998, c. 3, s. 27; 2000, c. 25, s. 32 (2-4); 2001, c. 23, s. 160. Program options (4)The following apply with respect to what a tax rebate program under this section may provide but is not required to provide: 1. The program may provide for rebates to organizations that are similar to eligible charities or a class of such organizations defined by the municipality. 2.

Determination of total assessment (3) Each local municipality shall determine the total assessment for each eligible property for the year or part of the year as follows: 1. Determine the level of assessment for each property identified by the Corporation under subsection (5) as a comparable property by dividing the total assessment on the frozen assessment listing of the property for 2000 by the assessment on the assessment roll for 2000. 2.

Despite paragraph 3, if the eligible property has been assessed under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act for 2000, determine the level of assessment for the eligible property by dividing the total assessment of the property for the year or portion of the year, as determined under subsection 447.10 (2), by the sum of the assessment on the assessment roll for 2000 and the assessment under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act. 5.
