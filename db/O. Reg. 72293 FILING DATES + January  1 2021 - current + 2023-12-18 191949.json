(1) For the purpose of subsection 2 (4) of the Act, if the Ministry provides a farming business registration form before the date by which it is to be filed as determined under paragraphs 1 and 2, the date by which the form shall be filed is determined in accordance with the following:  1. If the mailing address of the farming business is in Canada, the form shall be filed in each year on or before the date shown in Column 2 of the Table that is opposite the range of letters shown in Column 1 in which the fifth character of the postal code in the mailing address of the farming business falls.

If the mailing address of the farming business is outside Canada, the form shall be filed on or before March 1 in each year. 3. If the form cannot be filed by the relevant date as determined under paragraphs 1 and 2, a farming business that files the form on or before August 31 in the year may still be registered for that year, but not if the form is filed after that date.

(2) If the Ministry does not send the farming business registration form to the farming business’s mailing address before the relevant date as determined under paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection (1), the date by which the form shall be filed is the date that is 60 days after the date the Ministry sends the form or August 31 in the year, whichever occurs first.

(4) Despite the rules governing filing dates set out in subsections (1), (2) and (2.1), the official responsible for the administration of the farm business registration program may permit the filing of the form after the relevant date if the failure to file the form on time was, in the official’s opinion, due to the occurrence of an unexpected event beyond the control of the person filing or the refusal to accept the form for filing would cause undue hardship to the applicant.
