The temperature of the milk shall not be taken until the agitator has been in operation for at least two minutes or such longer period of time as is necessary for the milk to be thoroughly mixed. 2.  The temperature shall be taken a first time, i.  by reading the temperature displayed on the time temperature recorder for the bulk tank described in section 34.1, or ii.  if the time temperature recorder for the bulk tank has not displayed the temperature at the time the milk is picked up from the bulk tank, with an accurate hand thermometer with a stainless steel stem supplied by the bulk tank milk grader. 3.  If the temperature taken under paragraph 2 is higher than 10˚C, the temperature shall be taken a second time with an accurate hand thermometer described in subparagraph 2 ii. O.
