The Board shall calculate the weighted average municipal bill in the following manner: i. For each municipal distributor, multiply the number of municipal residential consumers to whom the municipal distributor distributes electricity by the amount payable to the municipal distributor by a municipal residential consumer for the first 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity consumed per month, not including any amount payable under subsection 79 (4) of the Act towards compensation for lost revenue resulting from rural or remote rate reduction. ii. Add together the products determined under subparagraph i in respect of all municipal distributors. iii. Divide the sum determined under subparagraph ii by the total number of municipal residential consumers to whom electricity is distributed by municipal distributors. 2. The Board shall calculate the weighted average rural bill for subsidiaries of the Services Corporation in the following manner: i. For each rate class that applies to rural residential consumers served by subsidiaries of the Services Corporation, multiply the number of premises occupied by those consumers to which the rate class applies by the amount that would be payable for the first 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity consumed per month in those premises, not including any amount payable under subsection 79 (4) of the Act towards compensation for lost revenue resulting from rural or remote rate reduction. ii. Add together the products determined under subparagraph i in respect of all rate classes that apply to rural residential consumers served by subsidiaries of the Services Corporation. iii. Divide the sum determined under subparagraph ii by the total number of premises occupied by rural residential consumers served by subsidiaries of the Services Corporation. 3.

Paragraph 3 does not prohibit the Board from calculating the amount of rural or remote rate reduction in a manner that results in the amount payable by particular consumers exceeding the weighted average municipal bill by more than 15 per cent.  O. Reg. 315/99, s. 4 (1).

O. Reg. 315/99, s. 4 (2). (3) Subject to subsection (4), the Board shall calculate the amount of rural or remote rate reduction for consumers referred to in paragraph 3 of subsection 3 (1) who occupy premises that are located in a municipality referred to in the Schedules in a manner that ensures that the total amount of rural or remote rate reduction for those consumers in each period set out in the Schedule that is applicable to that municipality is equal to the amount set out for that period in that Schedule.

After making orders fixing or approving rates for the distributors, the Board shall estimate, for the period for which the orders will be in effect, the total amount that must be recovered from consumers to compensate the distributors for lost revenue resulting from rural or remote rate reduction.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">2. The Board shall determine the monthly amount that must be collected from each consumer in order to collect the amount estimated under paragraph 1 by the end of the period for which the orders referred to in paragraph 1 are in effect.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">3. The Board may use different methods to determine, for different classes of consumers, the monthly amounts referred to in paragraph 2.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">4. The amount determined under paragraph 2 for a consumer shall be collected monthly by the distributor that distributes electricity to the consumer or, if the consumer is not a customer of a distributor, by the Generation Corporation.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">5. The due date for payment by a consumer of an amount to be collected under paragraph 4 shall be the same as the due date for payment of rates fixed or approved under section 78 of the Act.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">6.

If the amount collected under paragraph 4 during the period for which the orders referred to in paragraph 1 are in effect exceeds the actual amount necessary to compensate the distributors that distribute electricity to consumers who are eligible for rate protection under section 79 of the Act for lost revenue resulting from rural or remote rate reduction, the excess shall be applied against the amount necessary to compensate those distributors for the next period.</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">9.
