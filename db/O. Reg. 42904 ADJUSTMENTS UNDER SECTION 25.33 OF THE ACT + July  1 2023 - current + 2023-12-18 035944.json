            "content": " 11. (1) This section applies to adjustments to be made by the IESO under subsection 25.33 (1) of the Act.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (2) Subject to subsection (3), the IESO shall allocate the global adjustment for a month in an adjustment period as follows: 1.  Subject to paragraph 1.1, the IESO shall allocate as follows: i.  To every person or other entity that is a Class A market participant throughout the month to whom neither subsection 8.1 (3) nor (6) applies, the amount determined by multiplying the global adjustment for the month by the Class A market participant’s peak demand factor determined under subsection (4) for the adjustment period. ii.  To every person or other entity that is a Class A market participant at the beginning of the month but ceases to be a market participant before the end of the month, the amount that would otherwise be determined under subparagraph i multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the person or entity was a market participant to the total number of days in the month. iii.  To every person or other entity to whom subsection 8.1 (3) or (6) applies that is a Class A market participant in respect of the transferred load facility immediately before the effective date determined under subsection 8.1 (1), the amount that would otherwise be determined under subparagraph i of this paragraph, using the Class A market participant’s peak demand factor immediately before the effective date, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month before the effective date to the total number of days in the month. 1.1  For the purposes of applying paragraph 1, in the case of a Class A market participant that is an eligible cogeneration customer in respect of the adjustment period, the Class A market participant’s peak demand factor for the adjustment period shall be determined under subsection (4.2) instead of under subsection (4). 2.  The IESO shall make the following allocations, as applicable, to a licensed distributor who is a market participant: i.  The amount, if any, determined by multiplying the global adjustment for the month by the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor determined under subsection (5) for the adjustment period. ii.  The amount calculated using the formula, [(M – N) × (R + S – T – SU)] / (P – Q – U.1) in which, “M”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “N”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “P”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “Q”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “R”  is the volume of electricity withdrawn during the month by the licensed distributor from the IESO-controlled grid, “S”  is the total volume of electricity, adjusted for losses as required by the Retail Settlement Code, that was supplied by embedded generators during the month to the licensed distributor or to a wholly-embedded distributor of which the licensed distributor is the host distributor, and “T”  is the total volume of electricity distributed to Class A consumers during the month by the licensed distributor or by a wholly-embedded distributor of which the licensed distributor is the host distributor. “U.1”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “SU”  is the volume of electricity, if any, conveyed back into the distribution system of the licensed distributor, or into the distribution system of a wholly-embedded distributor of which the licensed distributor is the host distributor, during the month by electricity storage facilities that are Class B consumers. 3.  The IESO shall allocate for the month to each Class B market participant the amount calculated using the formula, [(M – N) × (U – SU.1)] / (P – Q – U.1) in which, “M”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “N”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “P”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “Q”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), and “U”  is the volume of electricity withdrawn from the IESO-controlled grid during the month by the Class B market participant. “U.1”  has the same meaning as in subsection 10 (1), “SU.1”  is the volume of electricity, if any, conveyed back into the IESO-controlled grid by electricity storage facilities that are Class B market participants. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 516/17, s. 3 (1-4); O. Reg. 265/19, s. 4 (1-3); O. Reg. 257/22, s. 16 (1), 18. (3) The IESO shall not allocate any amount for a month to, (a)  Ontario Power Generation Inc. in respect of the volume withdrawn from the IESO-controlled grid at the Sir Adam Beck Pump Generating Station; (b)  Fort Frances Power Corporation in respect of the volume withdrawn by it during the month from the IESO-controlled grid under its physical bilateral contract with Abitibi-Consolidated Hydro Limited Partnership; (c)  a market participant in respect of the volume withdrawn from the IESO-controlled grid in the course of providing ancillary services in accordance with the market rules; or (d)  a licensed distributor in respect of the volume of contracted non-Ontario electricity supplied to it or to any of its embedded distributors. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 257/22, s. 18; O. Reg. 116/23, s. 4. (4) For the purposes of subparagraph 1 i of subsection (2), the peak demand factor of a Class A market participant for an adjustment period is the amount calculated to eight decimal places using the formula, V/W in which, “V”  is the volume of electricity withdrawn by the Class A market participant from the IESO-controlled grid during the peak hours in the applicable base period, and “W”  is, subject to subsection (6), the amount calculated under subsection (4.1). O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 516/17, s. 3 (5); O. Reg. 257/22, s. 18. (4.1) For the purposes of the definition of “W” in subsection (4), the amount shall be calculated as follows: 1.  Calculate the sum of, i.  the total volume of electricity withdrawn by market participants from the IESO-controlled grid during the peak hours in the applicable base period, and ii.  the total volume of electricity, adjusted for losses as required by the Retail Settlement Code, that was supplied by embedded generators to licensed distributors during the peak hours in the applicable base period. 2.  Calculate the total volume of electricity, if any, conveyed back into the IESO-controlled grid or the distribution system of a licensed distributor by electricity storage facilities during the peak hours of the applicable base period. 3.  Subtract the amount calculated under paragraph 2 from the amount calculated under paragraph 1. O. Reg. 516/17, s. 3 (6); O. Reg. 257/22, s. 16 (2). (4.2) For the purposes of paragraph 1.1 of subsection (2), the peak demand factor of a Class A market participant that is an eligible cogeneration customer in respect of the adjustment period is calculated to eight decimal places using the formula, (V – V.1) /W in which, “V”  has the same meaning as in subsection (4), “V.1” is, subject to subsection (4.3), the volume of electricity conveyed into the IESO-controlled grid by one or more cogeneration facilities during the peak hours in the applicable base period, pursuant to one or more cogeneration capacity agreements between the owners or operators of cogeneration facilities and the Class A market participant, and “W”  has the same meaning as in subsection (4). O. Reg. 265/19, s. 4 (4). (4.3) The following rules apply for the purposes of determining the value of “V.1” in the formula set out in subsection (4.2): 1.  If the value of “V.1” is greater than the value of “V”, the value of “V” shall be substituted for the value of “V.1”. 2.  For the purposes of determining “V.1”, a volume of electricity shall only be included if the IESO is satisfied that the same volume of electricity was generated using capacity that is not the subject of a procurement contract entered into with the IESO or a capacity auction conducted by the IESO. 3.  For the purposes of determining “V.1”, the IESO shall rely on, i.  the information provided in the applicable cogeneration capacity agreement provided as described in section 10.7 to the IESO by the Class A market participant, and ii.  such other information as the IESO may require under section 10.8 for the purposes of this subsection. O. Reg. 265/19, s. 4 (4). (5) Subject to subsection (5.1), for the purposes of subparagraph 2 i of subsection (2), the peak demand factor for an adjustment period of a licensed distributor who is a market participant is the amount calculated to eight decimal places using the formula, X/W in which, “X”  is the total volume of electricity distributed during the peak hours in the applicable base period to consumers who are Class A consumers for the adjustment period by the licensed distributor or by a wholly-embedded distributor of which the licensed distributor is the host distributor, and “W”  has the same meaning as in subsection (4). O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 265/19, s. 4 (5). (5.1) If a licensed distributor who is a market participant distributes electricity to Class A consumers who are eligible cogeneration customers in respect of an adjustment period, the peak demand factor of the licensed distributor for the adjustment period is the amount calculated to eight decimal places using the formula, (X – X.1) /W in which, “X”  is the total volume of electricity distributed during the peak hours in the applicable base period to consumers who are Class A consumers for the adjustment period by the licensed distributor or by a wholly-embedded distributor of which the licensed distributor is the host distributor, “X.1” is, subject to subsection (5.2), the volume of electricity conveyed into the distribution system of the licensed distributor by one or more cogeneration facilities during the peak hours in the applicable base period, pursuant to one or more cogeneration capacity agreements between the owners or operators of cogeneration facilities and the licensed distributor’s customers who are both Class A consumers and eligible cogeneration customers, and “W”  has the same meaning as in subsection (4). O. Reg. 265/19, s. 4 (6). (5.2) The following rules apply for the purposes of determining the value of “X.1” in the formula set out in subsection (5.1): 1.  If the value of “X.1” is greater than the value of “X”, the value of “X” shall be substituted for the value of “X.1”. 2.  For the purposes of determining “X.1”, a volume of electricity shall only be included if the IESO is satisfied that the same volume of electricity was generated using capacity that is not the subject of a procurement contract entered into with the IESO or a capacity auction conducted by the IESO. 3.  For the purposes of determining “X.1”, the licensed distributor shall rely on, i.  the cogeneration capacity agreements provided as described in section 10.7 by each of the licensed distributor’s customers who are both Class A consumers and eligible cogeneration customers, and ii.  such other information as the licensed distributor may require under section 10.8 for the purposes of this subsection. O. Reg. 265/19, s. 4 (6). (6) The total volume of electricity supplied by embedded generators to licensed distributors during a peak hour may be calculated without reference to the volume of electricity supplied to a licensed distributor during the peak hours by an embedded generator if, (a)  the embedded generator’s name-plate capacity does not exceed 10 kilowatts; and (b)  the licensed distributor does not know the volume of electricity supplied by the embedded generator during the peak hour.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (7) The amount of the global adjustment for a month that is allocated by the IESO to a market participant who is neither a regulated consumer nor a licensed distributor is to be shown on the invoice issued by the IESO to the market participant for the month as a credit if the amount is negative or as an additional charge if the amount is positive.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (8) Amounts allocated by the IESO under subparagraph 2 i and ii of subsection (2) to a market participant who is a licensed distributor must be shown separately from each other and from any other amounts on the invoice issued by the IESO to the licensed distributor for the month.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (9) An amount allocated by the IESO under subparagraph 2 i or ii of subsection (2) to a market participant who is a licensed distributor must be shown on the invoice issued by the IESO to the licensed distributor for the month as a credit if the amount is negative or as an additional charge if the amount is positive.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (10) A settlement statement issued by the IESO to a market participant must show the market participant’s peak demand factor for the adjustment period.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (11) The IESO shall provide written notice to each Class A market participant of its peak demand factor, as calculated under this section for each adjustment period, on or before May 31 in the same calendar year in which the adjustment period commences. O. Reg. 257/22, s. 16 (3). (12) The IESO shall provide written notice to each licensed distributor who is a market participant of its peak demand factor, as calculated under this section for each adjustment period, on or before June 30 in the same calendar year in which the adjustment period commences.

(1) This section applies to adjustments to be made by licensed distributors under subsection 25.33 (2) of the Act with respect to Class A consumers.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (2) Subject to subsection (3), every licensed distributor shall allocate for a month to the account of a Class A consumer the amount calculated using the formula, GG × HH/II in which, “GG”  is the amount allocated for the month to the licensed distributor under subparagraph 2 i of subsection 11 (2) or under subsection 12 (2), “HH”  is the peak demand factor of the Class A consumer as determined under subsection (5) for the adjustment period, and “II”  is the peak demand factor of the licensed distributor as determined under subsection 11 (5) or 12 (3) for the adjustment period. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (3) Instead of the amount determined under subsection (2), in respect of a Class A consumer, a licensed distributor may allocate for a month to the account of the Class A consumer the amount calculated using the formula, (HH × JJ) + KK in which, “HH”  has the same meaning as in subsection (2), “JJ”  is the estimated global adjustment for the month as published by the IESO under subsection 1.1 (3), and “KK”  is the difference, if any, between the amount allocated to the Class A consumer under subsection (2) for the previous month and the amount that would be determined under this subsection for the previous month before adding the amount of “KK” for the previous month. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (4) If a licensed distributor changes the method of allocating to the account of a Class A consumer from the method permitted under subsection (3) to the method under subsection (2), the licensed distributor shall account for and provide details for each month of any difference in amounts between the two methods in the first invoice issued to the Class A consumer after the change.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (5) Subject to subsection (5.1), the peak demand factor of a Class A consumer for an adjustment period is the factor calculated to eight decimal places using the formula, LL/W in which, “LL”  is the total volume of electricity distributed to the Class A consumer by the licensed distributor during the peak hours in the applicable base period, and “W”  has the same meaning as in subsection 11 (4). O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 265/19, s. 5 (1). (5.1) If a Class A consumer is an eligible cogeneration customer in respect of an adjustment period, the peak demand factor of the consumer for the adjustment period is the amount calculated to eight decimal places using the formula, (LL – LL.1) /W in which, “LL”  has the same meaning as in subsection (5), “LL.1” is, subject to subsection (5.2), the volume of electricity conveyed into the distribution system of the licensed distributor by one or more cogeneration facilities during the peak hours in the applicable base period, pursuant to one or more cogeneration capacity agreements between the owners or operators of the cogeneration facilities and the Class A consumer, and “W”  has the same meaning as in subsection 11 (4). O. Reg. 265/19, s. 5 (2). (5.2) The following rules apply for the purposes of determining the value of “LL.1” in the formula set out in subsection (5.1): 1.  If the value of “LL.1” is greater than the value of “LL”, the value of “LL” shall be substituted for the value of “LL.1”. 2.  For the purposes of determining “LL.1”, a volume of electricity shall only be included if the IESO is satisfied that the same volume of electricity was generated using capacity that is not the subject of a procurement contract entered into with the IESO or a capacity auction conducted by the IESO. 3.  For the purposes of determining “LL.1”, the licensed distributor shall rely on, i.  the cogeneration capacity agreements provided as described in section 10.7 by the Class A consumer, and ii.  such other information as the licensed distributor may require under section 10.8 for the purposes of this subsection. 4.  For the purposes of paragraph 2, the IESO shall provide to the licensed distributor its determination in respect of each cogeneration capacity agreement of each of the licensed distributor’s customers on or before May 31 in the same calendar year in which the adjustment period commences. O. Reg. 265/19, s. 5 (2). (6) If the Class A consumer does not have a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall adjust the invoice issued to the Class A consumer for the month by giving a credit for the amount determined under subsection (2) or (3) if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subsection (2) or (3) as an additional charge if the amount is positive.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (7) If the Class A consumer has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall adjust the accounts between the licensed distributor and the retailer with whom the consumer has the contract by giving a credit for the amount determined under subsection (2) or (3) if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subsection (2) or (3) as an additional charge if the amount is positive.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (8) If, under subsection (7), a licensed distributor adjusts the accounts between the licensed distributor and a retailer with respect to a Class A consumer, the retailer shall adjust the invoice issued to the Class A consumer, (a)  by giving a credit in the same amount, if the licensed distributor gave a credit under subsection (7) with respect to the Class A consumer; or (b)  by adding an additional charge in the same amount, if the licensed distributor added an additional charge under subsection (7) with respect to the Class A consumer.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (9) If,  under subsection (6) or (8), an invoice issued to a Class A consumer is adjusted to give a credit or add an additional charge, the licensed distributor or retailer who issues the invoice to the consumer shall ensure that the invoice, (a)  clearly labels the credit or additional charge as “Global Adjustment”; (b)  clearly indicates the amount of the credit or additional charge; and (c)  includes the Class A consumer’s peak demand factor for the adjustment period.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (10) If a licensed distributor or retailer is unable for technical or operational reasons to adapt its invoices to include the peak demand factors of Class A consumers on the first invoices issued after 2010, it shall take steps to ensure that it does include Class A consumers’ peak demand factors for the applicable base period on invoices as soon as possible and on all invoices issued to Class A consumers on and after a day specified by the Minister.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (11) A licensed distributor shall provide written notice to each Class A consumer of its peak demand factor, as calculated under this section for each adjustment period, on or before May 31 in the same calendar year in which the adjustment period commences.

(1) The following rules apply if a licensed distributor ceases to distribute electricity to a Class A consumer during a month and, by the last business day of the month, knows the date on which it ceased distributing electricity to the Class A consumer: 1.  The amount of the global adjustment for the month allocated to the Class A consumer by the licensed distributor is adjusted to equal the amount that would otherwise be determined under section 12 for the month, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the licensed distributor distributed electricity to the Class A consumer to the total number of days in the month. 2.  If the licensed distributor is a wholly-embedded distributor, i.  its host distributor shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, A.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the wholly-embedded distributor for the month to reflect the adjustment in the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the Class A consumer by the wholly-embedded distributor under paragraph 1, and B.  to exclude amounts relating to the Class A consumer from the calculation of the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period, and ii.  the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, A.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the host distributor of the wholly-embedded distributor for the month to reflect the adjustment in the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the Class A consumer by the licensed distributor under paragraph 1, and B.  to the host distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period to reflect the change to the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor described in subsubparagraph i B. 3.  If the licensed distributor is a market participant, the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, i.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the licensed distributor for the month, and ii.  to the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor to exclude amounts relating to the Class A consumer from the calculation of the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period, 4.  The IESO, the licensed distributor and, if the licensed distributor is an embedded distributor, its host distributor shall exchange with one another such information concerning the Class A consumer’s peak demand factor and the adjustments as is necessary for the purposes of this subsection, within such time limits as the IESO specifies.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (2) Subsection (3) applies if, (a)  a Class A consumer, (i)  to whom electricity is distributed by a licensed distributor enters into a contract during a month with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, or (ii)  ceases during a month to have a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing; and (b)  the licensed distributor is informed of the date of the change described in subclause (a) (i) or (ii) no later than the last business day of the month.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (3) If this subsection applies, the following rules apply: 1.  The licensed distributor shall adjust the invoice issued to the Class A consumer for the month to equal the amount that would otherwise be determined under subsection 14 (6) for the month multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the consumer did not have a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing to the total number of days in the month. 2.  The licensed distributor shall adjust the accounts between the licensed distributor and the retailer with whom the consumer has the contract to equal the amount that would otherwise be determined under subsection 14 (7) for the month multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the consumer had a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing to the total number of days in the month. 3.  The retailer shall adjust the invoice issued to the Class A consumer for the month as follows: i.  If the licensed distributor gave a credit under paragraph 2 with respect to the Class A consumer, the retailer shall give a credit in the same amount. ii.  If the licensed distributor added an additional charge under paragraph 2 with respect to the Class A consumer, the retailer shall add an additional charge in the same amount. 4.  The licensed distributor and retailer shall exchange such information concerning the Class A consumer and the adjustments as is necessary for the purposes of this subsection within such time limits as the Board specifies.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (4) The following rules apply if a Class A market participant who was an embedded market participant is deemed under subsection 6 (3) during a month to become a Class A consumer for the remainder of the adjustment period: 1.  The licensed distributor shall adjust the invoice issued to the Class A consumer for the month to equal the amount that would otherwise be determined under subsection 14 (6) for the month multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the consumer was not a market participant to the total number of days in the month. 2.  If the licensed distributor is a wholly-embedded distributor, i.  its host distributor shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, A.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the wholly-embedded distributor for the month to reflect the adjustment in the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the Class A consumer by the wholly-embedded distributor under paragraph 1, and B.  to include amounts relating to the Class A consumer in the calculation of the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period, and ii.  the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, A.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the host distributor of the wholly-embedded distributor for the month to reflect the adjustment in the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the Class A consumer by the licensed distributor under paragraph 1, and B.  to the host distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period to reflect the change to the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor under subsubparagraph i B. 3.  If the licensed distributor is a market participant, the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, i.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the licensed distributor for the month, and ii.  to the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor to include amounts relating to the Class A consumer in the calculation of the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period. 4.  The IESO, the licensed distributor and, if the licensed distributor is a wholly-embedded distributor, its host distributor shall exchange with one another such information concerning the Class A market participant’s peak demand factor and the adjustments as is necessary for the purposes of this subsection within such time limits as the IESO specifies.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (5) The following rules apply if a Class A consumer becomes an embedded market participant during a month: 1.  The licensed distributor shall adjust the invoice issued to the Class A consumer for the month to equal the amount that would otherwise be determined under subsection 14 (6) for the month multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month before the person or entity became an embedded market participant to the total number of days in the month. 2.  If the licensed distributor is a wholly-embedded distributor, i.  its host distributor shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, A.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the wholly-embedded distributor for the month to reflect the adjustment in the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the Class A consumer by the wholly-embedded distributor under paragraph 1, and B.  to exclude amounts relating to the Class A consumer from the calculation of the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period, and ii.  the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, A.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the host distributor of the wholly-embedded distributor for the month to reflect the adjustment in the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the Class A consumer by the licensed distributor under paragraph 1, and B.  to the host distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period to reflect the change to the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor described in subsubparagraph i B. 3.  If the licensed distributor is a market participant, the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate, i.  to the amount of the global adjustment allocated to the licensed distributor for the month, and ii.  to the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor to exclude amounts relating to the Class A consumer from the calculation of the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period. 4.  If the Class A consumer is deemed under subsection 7 (4) during a month to become a Class A market participant for the remainder of the adjustment period, the IESO shall allocate to that Class A market participant the amount determined by multiplying the global adjustment for the month by the product of the Class A market participant’s peak demand factor multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the person or entity was a Class A market participant to the total number of days in the month. 5.  The IESO, the licensed distributor and, if the licensed distributor is a wholly-embedded distributor, its host distributor shall exchange with one another such information concerning the Class A consumer’s peak demand factor and the adjustments as is necessary for the purposes of this subsection, within such time limits as the IESO specifies.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (5.1) The following rules apply if a consumer to whom subsection 7 (5) applies becomes an embedded market participant during a month: 1.  The IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate to the peak demand factor for the Class A market participant who distributes electricity to the embedded market participant to exclude amounts relating to the embedded market participant from the calculation of the Class A market participant’s peak demand factor for the remainder of the adjustment period and for the subsequent adjustment period. 2.  The IESO shall allocate to the embedded market participant the amount determined by multiplying the global adjustment for the month by the product of the embedded market participant’s peak demand factor multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month during which the person or entity was an embedded market participant to the total number of days in the month. O. Reg. 263/16, s. 2. (6) The following rules apply to a transferor and transferee to which subsection 8 (3) or (6) applies during the month in which the effective date, as determined under subsection 8 (1), occurs, if the transferor is a Class A consumer in respect of the transferred load facility immediately before the effective date: 1.  The licensed distributor shall adjust the invoice issued to the transferor for the month to equal the sum of the following: i.  The amount that would otherwise be determined under subsection 14 (6) for the month multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the month before the effective date to the total number of days in the month. ii.  If subsection 8 (6) applies, the amount determined under subsection 14 (6) using the transferor’s peak demand factor, as calculated on the effective date, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the month, including the effective date, to the total number of days in the month. 2.  The licensed distributor shall adjust the invoice issued to the transferee for the month to equal the amount determined under subsection 14 (6) for the month using the transferee’s peak demand factor, as calculated on the effective date, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the month, including the effective date, to the total number of days in the month. O. Reg. 257/22, s. 17. (7) Subsection (8) applies if, (a)  a load facility or a portion of a load facility is transferred during a month; (b)  subsection 8.1 (3) or (6) applies to the transfer; and (c)  either the transferor, the transferee or both of them is a Class A market participant for the remainder of the adjustment period on and after the effective date determined under subsection 8.1 (1). O. Reg. 257/22, s. 17. (8) The IESO shall, for the month in which the effective date as determined under subsection 8.1 (1) occurs, do the following: 1.  If the transferee is a Class A market participant on the effective date, the IESO shall allocate to the transferee the amount determined by multiplying, i.  the global adjustment for the month, ii.  the transferee’s peak demand factor, as calculated on the effective date, and iii.  the ratio of the number of days remaining in the month, including the effective date, to the total number of days in the month. 2.  If subsection 8.1 (6) applies, the IESO shall allocate to the transferor, in addition to any amount allocated to them under subparagraph 1 iii of subsection 11 (2), the amount determined by multiplying, i.  the global adjustment for the month, ii.  the transferor’s peak demand factor, as calculated on the effective date, and iii.  the ratio of the number of days remaining in the month, including the effective date, to the total number of days in the month.

            "content": " 16. (1) This section applies to adjustments to be made by licensed distributors under subsection 25.33 (2) of the Act with respect to Class B consumers. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (1.1) In this section, “low-volume consumer” means a low-volume consumer as defined in section 56 of the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998; “specified Class B rate” means the Class B rate estimated or finally determined by the IESO that is used for the month by the licensed distributor in accordance with this section in respect of the Class B consumer. O. Reg. 311/13, s. 2 (1); O. Reg. 116/23, s. 5 (1). (2) In determining an adjustment under this section, a licensed distributor shall use, (a)  the first estimate of the Class B rate for the month made by the IESO and published no later than the last business day of the previous month; (b)  the second estimate of the Class B rate for the month made by the IESO and published no later than the last business day of the month; or (c)  the Class B rate for the month as finally determined by the IESO. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (3) If a licensed distributor chooses to use the estimate of a Class B rate described in clause (2) (a) or (b) in determining the amount to be allocated for a month to the account of a Class B consumer, it must do the following: 1.  Use the same Class B rate in respect of all Class B consumers who are included in the same consumer class in an order issued by the Board under subsection 78 (2) of the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998. 2.  Establish and maintain, in accordance with any protocols established by the Board, such variance accounts as may be necessary to record all differences arising by reason of using the estimate of the Class B rate instead of the actual Class B rate as finally determined by the IESO. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (4) Every licensed distributor shall make adjustments with respect to its Class B consumers who are not low-volume consumers in accordance with the following rules: 1.  For each Class B consumer whose electricity use is measured by an interval meter and who is neither a regulated consumer nor a consumer who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  for each month in the Class B consumer’s billing period, multiply the specified Class B rate for that month by the volume of electricity that was distributed to the Class B consumer by the licensed distributor in that month and subtract, in the case of a Class B consumer that is an electricity storage facility, the volume of electricity, if any, that was conveyed into the distribution system of the licensed distributor by the Class B consumer in that month, multiplied by the specified Class B rate for that month, ii.  add the monthly amounts determined under subparagraph i for the billing period, and iii.  adjust the invoice that the licensed distributor issues to the Class B consumer for the billing period by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph ii if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph ii as an additional charge if the amount is positive. 2.  For each Class B consumer whose electricity use is not measured by an interval meter and who is neither a regulated consumer nor a consumer who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  determine a weighted average rate applicable to the consumer’s billing period, based on the specified Class B rate for each month in the billing period and the hourly net system load shape determined in accordance with the Retail Settlement Code for each month in the billing period, ii.  multiply the weighted average rate determined under subparagraph i by the volume of electricity that was distributed to the Class B consumer during the billing period and subtract, in the case of a Class B consumer that is an electricity storage facility, the volume of electricity, if any, that was conveyed into the distribution system of the licensed distributor by the Class B consumer during the billing period, multiplied by the weighted average rate, and iii.  adjust the invoice that the licensed distributor issues to the Class B consumer for the billing period by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph ii if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph ii as an additional charge if the amount is positive. 3.  For each Class B consumer whose electricity use is measured by an interval meter and who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  for each month in the Class B consumer’s billing period, multiply the specified Class B rate for that month by the volume of electricity that was distributed to the Class B consumer by the licensed distributor in that month and subtract, in the case of a Class B consumer that is an electricity storage facility, the volume of electricity, if any, that was conveyed into the distribution system of the licensed distributor by the Class B consumer in that month, multiplied by the specified Class B rate for that month, ii.  add the monthly amounts determined under subparagraph i for the billing period, and iii.  adjust the accounts between the licensed distributor and the retailer with whom the Class B consumer has a contract by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph ii if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph ii as an additional charge if the amount is positive. 4.  For each Class B consumer whose electricity use is not measured by an interval meter and who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  determine a weighted average rate applicable to the consumer’s billing period, based on the specified Class B rate for each month in the billing period and the hourly net system load shape determined in accordance with the Retail Settlement Code for each month in the billing period, ii.  multiply the weighted average rate determined under subparagraph i by the volume of electricity that was distributed to the Class B consumer during the billing period and subtract, in the case of a Class B consumer that is an electricity storage facility, the volume of electricity, if any, that was conveyed into the distribution system of the licensed distributor by the Class B consumer during the billing period, multiplied by the weighted average rate, and iii.  adjust the accounts between the licensed distributor and the retailer with whom the Class B consumer has a contract by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph ii if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph ii as an additional charge if the amount is positive. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 311/13, s. 2 (2); O. Reg. 516/17, s. 5. (4.1) Every licensed distributor shall make adjustments with respect to its Class B consumers who are low-volume consumers in accordance with the following rules: 1.  For each Class B low-volume consumer, the licensed distributor shall make adjustments in accordance with the rules set out in subsection (4), except that, wherever those rules require the licensed distributor to use the volume of electricity in determining the amount of the adjustment, the licensed distributor shall use the volume of electricity exclusive of the volume for total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that is attributed to the consumer. 2.  For each Class B low-volume consumer, the licensed distributor shall make separate adjustments in accordance with subsection (4.2) regarding the volume of total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that is attributed to the consumer.

(4.2) Every licensed distributor shall make separate adjustments described in paragraph 2 of subsection (4.1) with respect to its Class B consumers who are low-volume consumers in accordance with the following rules: 1.  For each Class B low-volume consumer whose electricity use is measured by an interval meter and who is neither a regulated consumer nor a consumer who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  for each month in the Class B low-volume consumer’s billing period, multiply the specified Class B rate for that month by the volume of total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that is attributed to the consumer for that month, ii.  add the monthly amounts determined under subparagraph i for the billing period, and iii.  adjust the invoice that the licensed distributor issues to the Class B low-volume consumer for the billing period by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph ii if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph ii as an additional charge if the amount is positive. 2.  For each Class B low-volume consumer whose electricity use is not measured by an interval meter and who is neither a regulated consumer nor a consumer who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  multiply the weighted average rate determined for the billing period under subparagraph 2 i of subsection (4) by the volume of total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that is attributed to the consumer for the billing period, and ii.  adjust the invoice that the licensed distributor issues to the Class B low-volume consumer for the billing period by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph i if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph i as an additional charge if the amount is positive. 3.  For each Class B low-volume consumer whose electricity use is measured by an interval meter and who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  for each month in the Class B low-volume consumer’s billing period, multiply the specified Class B rate for that month by the volume of total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that is attributed to the consumer for that month, ii.  add the monthly amounts determined under subparagraph i for the billing period, and iii.  adjust the accounts between the licensed distributor and the retailer with whom the Class B low-volume consumer has a contract by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph ii if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph ii as an additional charge if the amount is positive. 4.  For each Class B low-volume consumer whose electricity use is not measured by an interval meter and who has a contract with a retailer who uses retailer-consolidated billing, the licensed distributor shall, i.  multiply the weighted average rate determined for the billing period under subparagraph 4 i of subsection (4) by the volume of total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that is attributed to the consumer for the billing period, and ii.  adjust the accounts between the licensed distributor and the retailer with whom the Class B low-volume consumer has a contract by giving a credit for the amount determined under subparagraph i if the amount is negative or by adding the amount determined under subparagraph i as an additional charge if the amount is positive.

(5) If, under subsection (4), a licensed distributor adjusts the accounts between the licensed distributor and a retailer with respect to a Class B consumer who is neither a low-volume consumer nor a regulated consumer, the retailer shall adjust the invoice that the retailer issues to the Class B consumer by, (a)  giving a credit in the same amount, if the licensed distributor gave a credit under subsection (4) with respect to the Class B consumer; or (b)  adding an additional charge in the same amount, if the licensed distributor added an additional charge under subsection (4) with respect to the Class B consumer. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 311/13, s. 2 (4). (5.1) If, under subsections (4.1) and (4.2), a licensed distributor adjusts the accounts between the licensed distributor and a retailer with respect to a Class B consumer who is a low-volume consumer and is not a regulated consumer, the retailer shall adjust the invoice that the retailer issues to the consumer by, (a)  giving a credit equal to the total of the adjustment made under paragraph 1 of subsection (4.1) and the adjustment made under paragraph 2 of subsection (4.1), if the licensed distributor gave a credit under subsections (4.1) and (4.2) with respect to the Class B low-volume consumer; or (b)  adding an additional charge equal to the total of the adjustment made under paragraph 1 of subsection (4.1) and the adjustment made under paragraph 2 of subsection (4.1), if the licensed distributor added additional charges under subsections (4.1) and (4.2) with respect to the Class B low-volume consumer. O. Reg. 311/13, s. 2 (5). (6) If, under subsection (4) or (5), an invoice issued to a Class B consumer who is not a low-volume consumer is adjusted to give a credit or add an additional charge, the licensed distributor or retailer who issues the invoice to the consumer shall ensure that the invoice, (a)  clearly labels the credit or additional charge as “Global Adjustment”; (b)  clearly indicates the amount of the credit or additional charge; (c)  clearly indicates the volume of electricity that was used to calculate the amount of the credit or additional charge; and (d)  clearly indicates the rate, in cents per kilowatt hour, that the volume referred to in clause (c) would have to be multiplied by to give the amount of the credit or additional charge. O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 311/13, s. 2 (6). (7) If, under subsections (4.1) and (4.2) or under subsection (5.1), an invoice issued to a Class B consumer who is a low-volume consumer is adjusted to give a credit or add an additional charge, the licensed distributor or retailer who issues the invoice to the consumer shall ensure that the invoice, in addition to meeting the requirements of Ontario Regulation 275/04 (Information on Invoices to Certain Classes of Consumers of Electricity) made under the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998, meets the following requirements: 1.  An additional sub-heading entitled “Global Adjustment” shall be added to the invoice after the sub-heading “Electricity” referred to in subsection 1 (2) of Ontario Regulation 275/04 but before the sub-heading “Delivery” referred to in that subsection. 2.  Under the sub-heading “Global Adjustment”, the invoice must clearly indicate, i.  the amount of the credit or additional charge, ii.  the volume of electricity, exclusive of the volume for total losses as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, that was used to calculate the amount of the credit or additional charge, and iii.  the rate, in cents per kilowatt hour, by which the volume of electricity referred to in subparagraph ii would have to be multiplied to give the amount of the credit or additional charge. 3.  The total cost of the delivery charges that are indicated under the sub-heading “Delivery” on the invoice under section 3 of Ontario Regulation 275/04 shall include the separate adjustment made for volume of total losses, as defined in the Retail Settlement Code, in accordance with subsection (4.2) of this section. 4.

(1) In this section, “extraordinary event” means, in respect of a consumer or market participant, (a)  a fire that damages the operations or facilities of the consumer or market participant, (b)  a natural disaster that directly adversely affects the operations or facilities of the consumer or market participant, (c)  the start of a strike, as defined in subsection 1 (1) of the Labour Relations Act, 1995, of employees of the consumer or market participant, or (d)  the commencement of an event that directly adversely affects the operations or facilities of the consumer or market participant to such an extent that the Minister considers it in the public interest to deem the event to be an extraordinary event for the purposes of this section.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (2) This section applies to a market participant if the IESO determines that the following conditions are satisfied: 1.  An extraordinary event occurs in respect of the market participant. 2.  The market participant is a Class A market participant or, but for the extraordinary event, could reasonably be expected to be a Class A market participant in the next adjustment period. 3.  The volume of electricity withdrawn from the IESO-controlled grid by the market participant in the month in which the extraordinary event occurred or in a subsequent month is less than 25 per cent of the average volume of electricity withdrawn by the market participant in the six months ending immediately before the month in which the extraordinary event occurred. 4.  It is reasonable to believe that the reduction in the volume of electricity withdrawn by the market participant from the IESO-controlled grid is the direct result of the extraordinary event. 5.  The market participant provides a notice to the IESO that the market participant wants this section to apply and provides to the IESO, i.  if the extraordinary event is described in clause (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of “extraordinary event” in subsection (1), such information concerning the extraordinary event as the Board may specify, or ii.  if the extraordinary event is described in clause (d) of the definition of “extraordinary event” in subsection (1), confirmation from the Minister that an extraordinary event has occurred and the date on which it commenced.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6; O. Reg. 257/22, s. 18. (3) If the IESO determines that this section applies to a market participant, the market participant is deemed to be a Class B market participant, (a)  for the month in which the notice and the information or confirmation are provided under paragraph 5 of subsection (2), if the notice and the information or confirmation are provided before the 15th day of that month; and (b)  for the remaining months, if any, in the adjustment period that are after the month referred to in clause (a).  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (4) This section applies to a consumer if the licensed distributor that distributes electricity to the consumer determines that the following conditions are satisfied: 1.  An extraordinary event occurs in respect of the consumer. 2.  The consumer is a Class A consumer or, but for the extraordinary event, could reasonably be expected to be a Class A consumer in the next adjustment period. 3.  The volume of electricity distributed to the consumer by the licensed distributor in the month in which the extraordinary event occurred or in a subsequent month is less than 25 per cent of the average volume distributed to the consumer in the six months ending immediately before the month in which the extraordinary event occurred. 4.  It is reasonable to believe that the reduction in the volume of electricity distributed to the consumer is the direct result of the extraordinary event. 5.  The consumer provides a notice to the licensed distributor that the consumer wants this section to apply and provides to the licensed distributor, i.  if the extraordinary event is described in clause (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of “extraordinary event” in subsection (1), such information concerning the extraordinary event as the Board may specify, or ii.  if the extraordinary event is described in clause (d) of the definition of “extraordinary event” in subsection (1), confirmation from the Minister that an extraordinary event has occurred and the date on which it commenced.  O. Reg. 398/10, s. 6. (5) The following rules apply if the licensed distributor determines this section applies to the consumer: 1.  The consumer is deemed to be a Class B consumer, i.  for the month in which the notice and the information or confirmation are provided under paragraph 5 of subsection (4), if the notice and the information or confirmation are provided before the 15th day of that month, and ii.  for the months, if any, remaining in the adjustment period that are after the month referred to in subparagraph i. 2.  If the licensed distributor who distributes electricity to the consumer is a wholly-embedded distributor, i.  its host distributor shall make such adjustments as are appropriate to the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor to exclude amounts relating to the consumer from the calculation of the distributor’s peak demand factor for the first month for which the consumer is deemed to be a Class B consumer and for the remainder of the adjustment period, and ii.  the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate to the host distributor’s peak demand factor to exclude amounts relating to the consumer from the calculation of the wholly-embedded distributor’s peak demand factor for the first month for which the consumer is deemed to be a Class B consumer and for the remainder of the adjustment period. 3.  If the licensed distributor is a market participant, the IESO shall make such adjustments as are appropriate to the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor to exclude amounts relating to the consumer from the calculation of the licensed distributor’s peak demand factor for the first month in which the consumer is deemed to be a Class B consumer and for the remainder of the adjustment period. 4.  The licensed distributor shall provide such information concerning the deemed Class B consumer and the adjustments as the IESO specifies to the IESO or, if the licensed distributor is a wholly-embedded distributor, to its host distributor, within such time limits as the IESO specifies.
