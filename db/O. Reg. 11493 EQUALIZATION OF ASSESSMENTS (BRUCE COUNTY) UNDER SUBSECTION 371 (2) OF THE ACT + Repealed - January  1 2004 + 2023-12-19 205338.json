(1) For the purposes of subsection 371 (2) of the Act, the standards described in this section must be considered in equalizing assessments within the classes of real property in the county and in computing the factors resulting from the application of the standards. (2) The proportion that the municipal and school board taxes levied for 1992 in each class of real property bears to the total municipal and school board taxes levied for 1992 must be maintained in such a way that the amount calculated using the formula,  is substantially the same as the amount calculated using the formula,  in which, “A” is the single mill rate which would have resulted in the amount of municipal and school board taxes levied for 1992 against the total assessment in 1992 of all of the properties that comprise the class, “B” is the total assessment in 1992 of all of the properties that comprise the class, and “C” is the total assessment of the class for the 1993 taxation year following the application of the assessment standards described in this section. (3) All real property within a class must, to the extent possible, be assessed at the same proportion of market value in relation to the base year 1988. (4) For the purpose of subsection (3), market value is as determined by the assessment commissioner in whose assessment region the real property is located. (5) The total assessment of the real property in the county, including assessments made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act, must not be substantially changed. (6) The assessment relationships between the classes of real property must not be significantly altered as a result of the application of the standards described in this section.
