(2) For the purposes of clause (1) (c), if any contracts were awarded for carrying out any part of the construction or installation, construction or installation is deemed to begin on the day on which the first contract was awarded. (3) The owner of a renewable energy generation facility referred to in clause (1) (c) shall maintain such records as are necessary to show the date on which construction or installation of the facility began and the date on which construction or installation of the facility was completed. (4) If a renewable energy generation facility mentioned in subsection (1) is subject to an extension, alteration, renovation or addition, section 62.0.2 of the Act, as it read immediately before its repeal by subsection 8 (9) of the Green Energy Repeal Act, 2018, continues to apply to the facility in accordance with the following rules: 1. If the facility is not the subject of a renewable energy approval mentioned in subsection 47.3 (1) of the Environmental Protection Act or an approval, registration or permit set out in subsection (5), section 62.0.2 of the Act continues to apply to the entire facility. 2. If the facility is a facility mentioned in clause (1) (a), section 62.0.2 of the Act continues to apply to only the portion of the facility that is on the parcel or parcels of land set out in the renewable energy approval mentioned in subsection 47.3 (1) of the Environmental Protection Act. 3. If the facility is a facility mentioned in clause (1) (b) but not a facility mentioned in clause (1) (a) and the facility is the subject of an approval, registration or permit set out in subsection (5), section 62.0.2 of the Act continues to apply to only the portion of the facility that is on the parcel or parcels of land set out in the contract referred to in clause (1) (b). 4. If the facility is a facility mentioned in clause (1) (c) but not a facility mentioned in clause (1) (a) or (b) and the facility is the subject of an approval, registration or permit set out in subsection (5), section 62.0.2 of the Act continues to apply to only the portion of the facility that is on the parcel or parcels of land on which the facility was constructed or installed before August 31, 2019.
