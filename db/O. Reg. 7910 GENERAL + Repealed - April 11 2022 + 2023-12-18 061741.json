Divide the resident’s annual net income by 12, and subtract an allowance of the amount set out in paragraph 1 of subsection 32 (1) of Ontario Regulation 222/98 (General) made under the Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997. Subject to paragraphs 2 to 4, the resulting amount is the maximum monthly amount that may be charged. 2. Where the resident requests a reduction to retain income to support one or more dependants, subtract the amount determined under subsection (10), (11) or (12) from the amount determined under paragraph 1. 3.

O. Reg. 79/10, s. 253 (12). (13) A resident who has not entered into an agreement mentioned in subsection (13.1) shall not be charged more than the amount payable for basic accommodation where the resident continues to occupy a bed in a room that was occupied with his or her spouse, and, (a) the spouse no longer occupies the room with the resident; (b) the resident has requested a transfer to basic accommodation in the home; and (c) the resident has not yet been transferred to basic accommodation in the home in accordance with subsection 207 (5).  O. Reg. 138/11, s. 3. (13.1) A resident shall enter into an agreement with the licensee for preferred accommodation, in accordance with paragraph 2 of subsection 91 (1) of the Act, where the resident wishes to continue to occupy a bed in a room that was occupied with his or her spouse and that room has ceased to be a standard room, and where the resident does not enter into an agreement, the licensee may transfer the resident to a standard room in accordance with subsection 207 (5), as if the resident had requested a transfer to a basic accommodation at the time the room ceased to be a standard room.  O. Reg. 138/11, s. 3. (14) Any amounts determined under this section for periods of less than a month, shall be determined by the Director proportionately.  O. Reg. 79/10, s. 253 (14).

O. Reg. 79/10, s. 253 (15); O. Reg. 108/12, s. 5 (3). (16) If the Director determines that the resident should have paid a higher maximum amount in prior terms, the resident shall repay the difference to the licensee before obtaining any further reduction under this section.  O. Reg. 108/12, s. 5 (4). (16.1) For a term that begins on July 1, 2012, the Director may retroactively adjust the maximum amount payable under this section that was determined for the same resident in prior terms as if the amendments made by Ontario Regulation 108/12 had been in force during the terms.  O. Reg. 108/12, s. 5 (4). (17) The Director may deny an application if, in the Director’s opinion, (a) the resident has not provided sufficient proof of financial need; or (b) the resident has provided false information on an application for a reduction.  O. Reg. 79/10, s. 253 (17). (18) Where the Director comes to the opinion that a resident has provided false information on an application for reduction after the Director has already determined the maximum amount payable by the resident based on the false information, the Director may, (a) retroactively deny the application; or (b) retroactively adjust the maximum amount payable that was determined for the resident based on the false information.  O. Reg. 79/10, s. 253 (18). (19) Where the Director determines that the resident should have paid a higher maximum amount under subsection (18), the resident shall repay the difference to the licensee before receiving any further reduction under this section.
