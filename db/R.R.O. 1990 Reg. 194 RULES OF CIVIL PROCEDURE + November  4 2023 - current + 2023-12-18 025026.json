Rules of Pleading â Applicable to all Pleadings Material Facts 25.06 (1) Every pleading shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the party relies for the claim or defence, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (1). Pleading Law (2) A party may raise any point of law in a pleading, but conclusions of law may be pleaded only if the material facts supporting them are pleaded.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (2). Condition Precedent (3) Allegations of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent to the assertion of a claim or defence of a party are implied in the partyâs pleading and need not be set out, and an opposite party who intends to contest the performance or occurrence of a condition precedent shall specify in the opposite partyâs pleading the condition and its non-performance or non-occurrence.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (3). Inconsistent Pleading (4) A party may make inconsistent allegations in a pleading where the pleading makes it clear that they are being pleaded in the alternative.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (4). (5) An allegation that is inconsistent with an allegation made in a partyâs previous pleading or that raises a new ground of claim shall not be made in a subsequent pleading but by way of amendment to the previous pleading.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (5). Notice (6) Where notice to a person is alleged, it is sufficient to allege notice as a fact unless the form or a precise term of the notice is material.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (6). Documents or Conversations (7) The effect of a document or the purport of a conversation, if material, shall be pleaded as briefly as possible, but the precise words of the document or conversation need not be pleaded unless those words are themselves material.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.06 (7).

Claim for Relief (9) Where a pleading contains a claim for relief, the nature of the relief claimed shall be specified and, where damages are claimed, (a) the amount claimed for each claimant in respect of each claim shall be stated; and (b) the amounts and particulars of special damages need only be pleaded to the extent that they are known at the date of the pleading, but notice of any further amounts and particulars shall be delivered forthwith after they become known and, in any event, not less than ten days before trial.

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.07 (2). Different Version of Facts (3) Where a party intends to prove a version of the facts different from that pleaded by the opposite party, a denial of the version so pleaded is not sufficient, but the party shall plead the partyâs own version of the facts in the defence.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.07 (3). Affirmative Defences (4) In a defence, a party shall plead any matter on which the party intends to rely to defeat the claim of the opposite party and which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise or raise an issue that has not been raised in the opposite partyâs pleading.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.07 (4). Effect of Denial of Agreement (5) Where an agreement is alleged in a pleading, a denial of the agreement by the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial of the making of the agreement or of the facts from which the agreement may be implied by law, and not as a denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of the agreement.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.07 (5). Damages (6) In an action for damages, the amount of damages shall be deemed to be in issue unless specifically admitted.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.07 (6). Where a Reply Is Necessary Different Version of Facts 25.08 (1) A party who intends to prove a version of the facts different from that pleaded in the opposite partyâs defence shall deliver a reply setting out the different version, unless it has already been pleaded in the claim.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.08 (1). Affirmative Reply (2) A party who intends to reply in response to a defence on any matter that might, if not specifically pleaded, take the opposite party by surprise or raise an issue that has not been raised by a previous pleading shall deliver a reply setting out that matter, subject to subrule 25.06 (5) (inconsistent claims or new claims).  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.08 (2). Reply Only Where Required (3) A party shall not deliver a reply except where required to do so by subrule (1) or (2).  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 25.08 (3).

O. Reg. 438/08, s. 29. Considerations for Leave (2) In determining whether leave should be granted under subrule (1), the court shall consider, (a) the amount of money in issue; (b) the complexity of the issues of fact or law; (c) the amount of time that ought reasonably to be required in the action for oral examinations; (d) the financial position of each party; (e) the conduct of any party, including a partyâs unresponsiveness in any examinations for discovery held previously in the action, such as failure to answer questions on grounds other than privilege or the questions being obviously irrelevant, failure to provide complete answers to questions, or providing answers that are evasive, irrelevant, unresponsive or unduly lengthy; (f) a partyâs denial or refusal to admit anything that should have been admitted; and (g) any other reason that should be considered in the interest of justice.

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 31.06 (5). Divided Discovery (6) Where information may become relevant only after the determination of an issue in the action and the disclosure of the information before the issue is determined would seriously prejudice a party, the court on the partyâs motion may grant leave to withhold the information until after the issue has been determined.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 31.06 (6).

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 31.11 (6). (7) In deciding whether to grant leave under subrule (6), the trial judge shall consider, (a) the extent to which the person was cross-examined on the examination for discovery; (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding; (c) the general principle that evidence should be presented orally in court; and (d) any other relevant factor.

Adding Subsequent Encumbrancers (4) Subject to subrule 64.05 (2) (subsequent encumbrancers in redemption action), the referee shall direct all persons who appear to have a lien, charge or encumbrance on the mortgaged property subsequent to the mortgage in question and who were not named as defendants in the statement of claim to be added as defendants and to be served with a notice of reference to subsequent encumbrancer added on reference (Form 64N).  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (4). (5) A subsequent encumbrancer added under subrule (4) may be served with documents on the reference, (a) in the case of an execution creditor, by mail at the address shown on the writ of execution or the most recent request to renew it or, if the creditorâs address is not shown, by serving the creditorâs lawyer in a manner authorized by subrule 16.05 (1); (b) in the case of a person who has registered a claim for lien under the Construction Act, by mail at the address for service shown on the claim for lien; or (c) in any other case, personally or by an alternative to personal service under rule 16.03.

(7) Where it appears to the referee that a person who was named as a defendant in the statement of claim may have a lien, charge or encumbrance on the mortgaged property subsequent to the mortgage in question, although the person was not alleged to be a subsequent encumbrancer in the statement of claim, the referee shall direct that defendant to be served with a notice of reference to subsequent encumbrancer named as original party (Form 64O).  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (7). Notice of Reference to Original Defendants (8) Subject to subrule (10), all persons who were named as defendants in the statement of claim shall be served with a notice of reference to original defendants (Form 64P), stating the names and nature of the claims of all those appearing to have a lien, charge or encumbrance on the mortgaged property.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (8).

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (10). Adding Parties Other than Encumbrancers (11) Where on a reference it appears that there are persons interested in the equity of redemption, other than subsequent encumbrancers, who are not already defendants to the action, the referee may order that they be added as defendants on the reference on such terms as are just, and the order shall be served on them, together with the judgment in the action and a notice to added party (Form 64Q), personally or by an alternative to personal service under rule 16.03.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (11). (12) A defendant added under subrule (11) may move within ten days after service of the material referred to in subrule (11), or where the defendant is served outside Ontario, within such further time as the referee directs, to set aside or vary the judgment in the action or the order adding the person as a defendant.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (12). Where more than one Party Entitled to Redeem (13) One day shall be fixed for payment by all the parties entitled to redeem and, where more than one party is entitled to redeem, the referee shall determine the priority in which they are so entitled.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (13). (14) Where more than one defendant entitled to redeem makes payment, any such defendant may make a motion on the reference for further directions.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (14). Proof of Account where Mortgage Assigned (15) In an action for foreclosure or sale by, or for redemption against, an assignee of a mortgagee, a statement of the mortgage account, verified by affidavit of the assignee, may be taken as proof of the state of the account and an affidavit is not required from the mortgagee or any intermediate assignee denying any payment to the mortgagee or intermediate assignee, unless the mortgagor or the mortgagorâs assignee, or any party entitled to redeem, denies by affidavit the correctness of the statement of account.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (15). Refereeâs Report (16) The referee shall set out in the report on the reference, (a) the names of, (i) all persons who were parties on the reference, (ii) all subsequent encumbrancers who were served with notice of the reference, and (iii) all subsequent encumbrancers who failed to attend on the reference and prove their claims; (b) the amount and priority of the claims of the parties who attended and proved their claims on the reference, and the report shall show those parties as the only encumbrancers of the property; and (c) the date on which the report was settled.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (16). (17) The report shall be served on all parties who attended on the reference and on any defendant who filed a request to redeem or a request for sale and shall be filed with proof of service.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (17). (18) Where any period fixed for payment expires within fifteen days after confirmation of the report, a new account shall be taken.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (18). Mortgagee to Transfer Property where Redeemed (19) Subject to the Mortgages Act, where a party pays the amount found due on the mortgage, the mortgagee shall, unless the judgment directs otherwise, transfer the mortgaged property to the party making the payment or the partyâs nominee, free and clear of all encumbrances incurred by the mortgagee, and the mortgagee shall deliver up all instruments in the mortgageeâs possession, control or power that relate to the mortgaged property.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (19). Registrar May Request Directions (20) A registrar who is of the opinion that a mortgage reference directed to him or her ought to be dealt with by a judge may request directions from a judge.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (20). Change of Account (21) Where the state of account as ascertained by an order or report has changed before the day fixed for payment, the mortgagee may, at least fifteen days before that day, serve notice of the change of account on the person required to pay, giving particulars of the change of account and of the sum to be paid.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (21). (22) Where notice of a change of account has been served and the sums mentioned in it are proper, the court may make a final order without further notice or, on the motion for a final order, may fix a new day for payment and may require notice to be served.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (22). (23) A party served with notice of change of account who is dissatisfied may make a motion to the court to determine the amount to be paid and to fix a new day for payment.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (23). (24) Where the state of account has changed before the day fixed for payment and notice of the change has not been served, (a) where the amount payable for redemption is reduced, a new day shall be fixed for payment, on notice to the persons entitled to redeem; or (b) where the amount payable for redemption has increased, the mortgagee may move for a final order after the day fixed for payment, without the fixing of a new day.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (24). (25) Where the state of the new account has changed after the day fixed for payment, it is not necessary to fix a new day, unless the court so directs on the motion for a final order.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (25). (26) Where it becomes necessary to fix a new day for payment after the expiration of the original period, the further time allowed shall be thirty days, unless the court orders otherwise.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (26). (27) Despite subrule (26), the court may, on motion of any party, extend or abridge the time for redemption for such time and on such terms as are just.

(7) Where it appears to the referee that a person who was named as a defendant in the statement of claim may have a lien, charge or encumbrance on the mortgaged property subsequent to the mortgage in question, although the person was not alleged to be a subsequent encumbrancer in the statement of claim, the referee shall direct that defendant to be served with a notice of reference to subsequent encumbrancer named as original party (Form 64O).  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (7).

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (10). Adding Parties Other than Encumbrancers (11) Where on a reference it appears that there are persons interested in the equity of redemption, other than subsequent encumbrancers, who are not already defendants to the action, the referee may order that they be added as defendants on the reference on such terms as are just, and the order shall be served on them, together with the judgment in the action and a notice to added party (Form 64Q), personally or by an alternative to personal service under rule 16.03.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (11). (12) A defendant added under subrule (11) may move within ten days after service of the material referred to in subrule (11), or where the defendant is served outside Ontario, within such further time as the referee directs, to set aside or vary the judgment in the action or the order adding the person as a defendant.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (12). Where more than one Party Entitled to Redeem (13) One day shall be fixed for payment by all the parties entitled to redeem and, where more than one party is entitled to redeem, the referee shall determine the priority in which they are so entitled.

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (14). Proof of Account where Mortgage Assigned (15) In an action for foreclosure or sale by, or for redemption against, an assignee of a mortgagee, a statement of the mortgage account, verified by affidavit of the assignee, may be taken as proof of the state of the account and an affidavit is not required from the mortgagee or any intermediate assignee denying any payment to the mortgagee or intermediate assignee, unless the mortgagor or the mortgagorâs assignee, or any party entitled to redeem, denies by affidavit the correctness of the statement of account.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (15). Refereeâs Report (16) The referee shall set out in the report on the reference, (a) the names of, (i) all persons who were parties on the reference, (ii) all subsequent encumbrancers who were served with notice of the reference, and (iii) all subsequent encumbrancers who failed to attend on the reference and prove their claims; (b) the amount and priority of the claims of the parties who attended and proved their claims on the reference, and the report shall show those parties as the only encumbrancers of the property; and (c) the date on which the report was settled.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (16). (17) The report shall be served on all parties who attended on the reference and on any defendant who filed a request to redeem or a request for sale and shall be filed with proof of service.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (17). (18) Where any period fixed for payment expires within fifteen days after confirmation of the report, a new account shall be taken.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (18). Mortgagee to Transfer Property where Redeemed (19) Subject to the Mortgages Act, where a party pays the amount found due on the mortgage, the mortgagee shall, unless the judgment directs otherwise, transfer the mortgaged property to the party making the payment or the partyâs nominee, free and clear of all encumbrances incurred by the mortgagee, and the mortgagee shall deliver up all instruments in the mortgageeâs possession, control or power that relate to the mortgaged property.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (19). Registrar May Request Directions (20) A registrar who is of the opinion that a mortgage reference directed to him or her ought to be dealt with by a judge may request directions from a judge.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (20). Change of Account (21) Where the state of account as ascertained by an order or report has changed before the day fixed for payment, the mortgagee may, at least fifteen days before that day, serve notice of the change of account on the person required to pay, giving particulars of the change of account and of the sum to be paid.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (21). (22) Where notice of a change of account has been served and the sums mentioned in it are proper, the court may make a final order without further notice or, on the motion for a final order, may fix a new day for payment and may require notice to be served.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (22). (23) A party served with notice of change of account who is dissatisfied may make a motion to the court to determine the amount to be paid and to fix a new day for payment.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (23). (24) Where the state of account has changed before the day fixed for payment and notice of the change has not been served, (a) where the amount payable for redemption is reduced, a new day shall be fixed for payment, on notice to the persons entitled to redeem; or (b) where the amount payable for redemption has increased, the mortgagee may move for a final order after the day fixed for payment, without the fixing of a new day.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (24). (25) Where the state of the new account has changed after the day fixed for payment, it is not necessary to fix a new day, unless the court so directs on the motion for a final order.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (25). (26) Where it becomes necessary to fix a new day for payment after the expiration of the original period, the further time allowed shall be thirty days, unless the court orders otherwise.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 64.06 (26). (27) Despite subrule (26), the court may, on motion of any party, extend or abridge the time for redemption for such time and on such terms as are just.
