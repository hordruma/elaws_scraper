O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4. (2) Services that are rendered outside Canada at a hospital or health facility are prescribed as insured services if, (a)  the service is generally accepted by the medical profession in Ontario as appropriate for a person in the same medical circumstances as the insured person; (b)  the service is medically necessary; (c)  either, (i) the identical or equivalent service is not performed in Ontario, or (ii) the identical or equivalent service is performed in Ontario but it is necessary that the insured person travel out of Canada to avoid a delay that would result in death or medically significant irreversible tissue damage; (d)  in the case of a hospital service or a service rendered in a health facility, the service, if performed in Ontario, is one to which the insured person would be entitled without charge pursuant to section 7 in the case of an in-patient service or section 8 in the case of an out-patient service; and (e)  in the case of a service performed for an insured person who is admitted as an in-patient at a hospital or for an overnight stay at a health facility in Ontario, the insured person would ordinarily have been admitted to a public hospital as an in-patient. O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4; O. Reg. 76/12, s. 7 (1). (3) Services that are rendered outside Canada at a hospital or health facility are prescribed as insured services if, (a) the conditions in clauses (2) (a), (b), (d) and (e) are satisfied; and (b)  the service is rendered in urgent circumstances in order to treat medical complications resulting or arising from services, (i)  that are insured services under subsection (2), (ii)  that are rendered in circumstances that are not emergency circumstances, and (iii)  for which written approval of payment was granted before the services are rendered, in accordance with subparagraph 1 i of subsection (4).  O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4. (3.1) Despite anything in this section, this section does not apply to a service that is a therapeutic laboratory service or a diagnostic laboratory test, unless the therapeutic laboratory service or diagnostic laboratory test is necessary for the purpose of rendering a service that is insured under this section and that is not a therapeutic laboratory service or diagnostic laboratory test.  O. Reg. 83/11, s. 3 (1). (4) Despite anything in this section as it read before April 1, 2009, a service is not, and is deemed never to have been, an insured service under this section unless the following conditions are satisfied: 1.  For services rendered in circumstances that are not emergency circumstances, i.  written approval of payment of the amount for the services is granted by the General Manager before the services are rendered, and ii.  the services are rendered within the time limit set out in the written approval. 2.  For services rendered in emergency circumstances, written approval of payment of the amount for the services is granted by the General Manager, either before or after the services are rendered.  O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4. (5) For the purposes of clause (2) (c), a service is performed in Ontario if the service can be legally obtained by an insured person in Ontario and includes, (a)  services that are prescribed as insured services, other than under this section; (b)  services that are publicly funded, in whole or in part; (c)  services that are for sale anywhere in Ontario to a person in the same medical circumstances as the insured person; and (d)  services that a person in the same medical circumstances as the insured person is eligible to receive in Ontario under or through any program or policy, including a program or policy permitting special or extraordinary access to the services.  O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4. (6) The amount payable for insured services prescribed by subsections (2) and (3) is determined as follows: 1.  If the services are rendered in a hospital whose operator is a preferred provider, the amount payable is the amount provided in the preferred provider arrangement. 2.  If the services are covered by one or more preferred provider arrangements, but the insured person receives identical or equivalent services in or from a hospital or health facility whose operator is not a preferred provider, the amount payable is nil. 3.  If the services are not covered by a preferred provider arrangement, the amount payable is the usual and customary amount charged by similar facilities under similar circumstances to major insurers for services rendered, to persons they insure, in facilities located in the jurisdiction where the insured services are rendered.  O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4. (7) An amount is payable for insured services prescribed by subsection (2) if the following conditions are met: 1.  An application for approval of payment is submitted to the General Manager on behalf of the insured person, i.  by a physician who practises medicine in Ontario, or ii.  by an emergency patient referral service, but only in emergency circumstances. 2.  The application mentioned in paragraph 1 includes written confirmation that the conditions set out in clauses (2) (a) and (b) and one of the conditions set out in clause (2) (c) are satisfied, from, i.  a physician who is a specialist, as defined in the schedule of benefits, in the type of service for which approval of payment is sought, ii.  a general practitioner, if the type of service for which approval of payment is sought is within the general practitioner’s scope of practice, or iii.  in emergency circumstances, a physician who practises medicine in Ontario or an emergency patient referral service. 3.  In circumstances that are not emergency circumstances, a service that is identical or equivalent to the service for which payment is sought is not covered by a preferred provider arrangement entered into, i.  between the Minister and the operator of a hospital outside Ontario but within Canada under subsection 27 (1), ii.  between the Minister and the operator of a health facility outside Ontario but within Canada under subsection 27 (2), or iii.  between the Minister and a physician or practitioner outside Ontario but within Canada under subsection 27 (4). 4.  For a service that consists primarily of the administration of a drug, including the provision of the drug that is administered, there is a recommendation from the executive officer appointed under the Ontario Drug Benefit Act for payment for the drug for a person in the same medical circumstances as the insured person.  O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4; O. Reg. 83/11, s. 3 (2, 3). (7.1) For the purposes of subclause (2) (c) (i), if there is a physician in Ontario who has provided written confirmation that he or she is available to provide the service that is the subject of an application under subsection (7) and the service is within the physician’s scope of practice, the service is deemed to be identical or equivalent to the service that is the subject of the application.  O. Reg. 83/11, s. 3 (4). (7.2) For the purposes of paragraph 3 of subsection (7), if there is a physician in Canada who has provided written confirmation that he or she is available to provide the service that is the subject of an application under subsection (7) and the service is within the physician’s scope of practice, the service is deemed to be identical or equivalent to the service that is the subject of the application.  O. Reg. 83/11, s. 3 (4). (8) An amount is payable for insured services prescribed by subsection (3) if the following conditions are met: 1.  An application for approval of payment is submitted to the General Manager by or on behalf of the insured person. 2.  The application includes written confirmation from the hospital or health facility in which the service is rendered that, in the opinion of the hospital or health facility, i.  the service is rendered in urgent circumstances in order to treat medical complications resulting or arising from services that are insured services under subsection (2), and ii.  the service is medically necessary.  O. Reg. 135/09, s. 4. (9) Subject to subsection (4), this section, as it read immediately before April 1, 2014, continues to apply to applications for approval of payment for services in circumstances that are not emergency circumstances, (a)  if the applications were mailed, faxed or otherwise delivered to the General Manager before that date; or (b)  if the applications are in respect of the continuation or extension of the same service for which approval was granted before that date, as long as, (i)  the service is for the same insured person, (ii)  the service is for the same medical condition, and (iii)  the insured person has been outside of Canada receiving the service at a hospital or health facility on a continuous basis without having returned to Ontario since before April 1, 2014.

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, s. 39 (4). (5) Where the insured person and the General Manager cannot agree as to any offer of settlement in the action the insured person may make a settlement of his or her claims and thereafter the General Manager shall have the conduct of the action.

(6) Subject to subsection (8), where an insured person obtains a final judgment in an action in which he or she includes a claim on behalf of the Plan, the Plan shall bear the same proportion of the taxable costs otherwise payable by the insured person, whether on a party and party basis or on a solicitor and client basis, as the recovery made on behalf of the Plan bears to the total recovery of the insured person in the action or, where no recovery is made, as the assessed claim of the Plan bears to the total damages of the insured person assessed by the court.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, s. 39 (6). (7) Where a claim is settled, the Plan shall bear the same proportion of the taxable costs otherwise payable by the insured person as is set out in subsection (6) in respect of a recovery made.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, s. 39 (7). (8) The costs for which the Plan may be liable to bear a portion under subsection (6) are the costs of bringing the action to the conclusion of the trial only and do not include the costs of any other proceeding without the written consent of the General Manager.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, s. 39 (8). (9) If no action has been commenced by an insured person for the recovery of damages arising out of injury or disability within eleven months of the last act or omission that caused or contributed to the injury or disability, or thirty days before the expiration of the limitation period for the action, whichever occurs first, the General Manager, (a)  after notice thereof to the insured person, may commence an action in the name of the Plan or in the name of the insured for damages in the amount of the costs of insured services; and (b)  may effect settlement of the claim without prejudice to the right of the insured person to commence an action to recover for his or her injuries or other damages.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, s. 39 (9). (10) The insured person, at any time prior to the trial of an action commenced under clause (9) (a), may, subject to the rules of court, join in such action any additional claims arising out of the same occurrence and thereafter the insured person shall have the conduct of the action as if he or she had commenced it under section 31 of the Act.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, s. 39 (10). (11) Where the insured person is a minor or under other disability or has died, the General Manager may commence an action in the name of the Plan for the recovery of the cost of insured services rendered to the person and, in that event, shall forthwith give notice of the institution of such action to the parent or guardian of the minor, or to a lawfully authorized substitute decision maker, or to the personal representative, if any, of the deceased person, and subsections (9) and (10) apply with necessary modifications to such action.
