Disposal of surplus (8) The surplus shall be paid into the general funds of the municipality, school board or local board, as the case may be, if, in the next regular election, the candidate for whose benefit the surplus is held in trust under subsection (1), (a) notifies the clerk in writing that the candidate does not intend to seek nomination; (b) fails to be nominated; (c) is ineligible to be nominated; or (d) fails to become registered.
