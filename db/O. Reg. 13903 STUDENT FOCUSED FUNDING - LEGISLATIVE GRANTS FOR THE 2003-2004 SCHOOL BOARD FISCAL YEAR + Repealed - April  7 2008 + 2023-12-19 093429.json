Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (2). (3) For example, cell C-1 of Table 5 contains the number 0.6127 and cell A1/Group 1-3 contains the number 0.7416. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (3). (4) For the purposes of this section, the number of teachers employed by a board is the full-time equivalent number of persons employed by the board as of October 31, 2003 to teach. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (4). (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the counting practices usually followed by the board for staffing purposes must be followed, subject to the following rules: 1. A teacher who is not assigned to provide instruction to pupils of the board in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2003 is not counted for the purposes of this section, unless the teacher satisfies the conditions described in subsection (6). 2. The provision of library instruction or guidance to pupils is considered the provision of instruction to pupils for the purposes of paragraphs 1, 3 and 4. 3. If a teacher is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2003 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils of the board and is also assigned, as of that date, under section 17 of Regulation 298 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990, to spend part of his or her time acting as a consultant, co-ordinator or supervisor, the full-time equivalency for the teacher is determined as follows: i.

O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (6). (7) The number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2003-2004 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (7). (8) If the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, the number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher is deemed to be 10. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (8). (9) The number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be 10. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (9). (10) The following rules apply, as of October 31, 2003, to determine the qualification category of a teacher: 1. If a board uses an AEFO certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that AEFO certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 2. If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2003 Data Form A submitted to the Office of Collective Bargaining Information of the Ministry of Labour is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2003 Data Form A submitted to the Office of Collective Bargaining Information of the Ministry of Labour is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2003 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2003-2004 school year and October 31, 2003, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (10). (11) The amount of the teacher qualification and experience allocation for a district school board is the total of the elementary school teacher qualification and experience allocation and the secondary school teacher qualification and experience allocation. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (11). (12) The amount of the elementary school teacher qualification and experience allocation for a district school board is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 5, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or Group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/Group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 5, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in that Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils. 5. Subtract one from the number obtained under paragraph 4. 6. Multiply the result obtained under paragraph 5 by $2,810. 7.

(13) The amount of the secondary school teacher qualification and experience allocation for a district school board is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 5, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or Group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/Group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 5, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in that Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils. 5. Subtract one from the number obtained under paragraph 4. 6. Multiply the result obtained under paragraph 5 by $3,418. 7. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by the 2003-2004 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board. 8. Determine the special assistance amount, if any, for a high credit per pupil average, in accordance with subsection (14). 9. Add the amounts determined under paragraphs 7 and 8. O. Reg. 139/03, s. 33 (13). (14) The special assistance amount for a high credit per pupil average is determined as follows: 1. Determine the average number of credits per secondary school pupil of the board for the 2002-2003 school year. 2. If the number determined under paragraph 1 is 7.5 or less but more than 7.2, deduct 7.2 from the number determined under paragraph 1. 3. If the number determined under paragraph 1 is more than 7.5, deduct 7.2 from 7.5. 4. Divide the number obtained under paragraph 2 or 3, as the case may be, by 7.2. 5. Multiply the number obtained under paragraph 4 by $3,194. 6.
