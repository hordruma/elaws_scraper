The value of the landlord’s own labour in carrying out the work involved in the capital expenditure is equal to the amount of time spent multiplied by a rate of pay that is reasonable given the landlord’s experience and skill in the type of work done. If the amount of time spent exceeds the amount of time that would be reasonable given the landlord’s experience and skill, the latter amount of time shall be used in the calculation of the value of the landlord’s own labour.

The value of the landlord’s own labour does not include any amount with respect to the management and administration of the work involved in the capital expenditure. 4. The cost of a leased asset is the fair market value of the leased asset at the commencement of the lease. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, the amount of a capital expenditure is calculated as follows: i. Add the total of the purchase prices, the cost of any leased assets and the installation, renovation and construction costs, other than the value of the landlord’s own labour as determined under paragraph 3. ii. Multiply that sum by 1.05 as an allowance for management and administration. iii.

Multiply the amount determined under subparagraph iv by the factor determined under subsection 17 (2). 6. The amount of a capital expenditure for furniture or appliances is calculated as follows: i. Add the total of the purchase prices, the cost of any leased assets and the installation, renovation and construction costs. ii. Add to that sum the value of the landlord’s own labour, as determined under paragraph 3. iii.

Multiply the amount determined under subparagraph iii by the factor determined under subsection 17 (2). 7. The allowance for each capital expenditure is the amount of the capital expenditure amortized over the useful life of the work done or the thing purchased, as determined in accordance with section 23, in equal instalments of blended principal and interest. 8.

The nature, duration and degree of interference with the tenant’s reasonable enjoyment caused by the carrying out of the work. 2. Whether the tenant is responsible for any undue delay in the carrying out of the work. 3. The steps taken by the landlord during the work to minimize interference with the tenant’s reasonable enjoyment. 4.

Whether a failure to carry out the work could reasonably be expected to result in any of the following within a reasonable period of time: i. Interference with the tenant’s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or the residential complex. ii. A reduction or discontinuation of a service or facility. iii.

If a tax notice respecting the reference year municipal taxes and charges is issued on or after November 1 in the base year, i. subtract from the base year costs for municipal taxes and charges the amount, if any, by which the municipal taxes and charges for the year preceding the reference year exceed the reference year municipal taxes and charges, and ii. if the reference year municipal taxes and charges are decreased as a result of an appeal of a tax assessment, the amount of the decrease resulting from the appeal, A. shall be taken into account in determining the amount by which the municipal taxes and charges for the year preceding the reference year exceed the reference year municipal taxes and charges for the purpose of subparagraph i, and B. shall not be subtracted under paragraph 1. 3.
