O. Reg. 241/19, s. 1 (3). (4) Each of the following changes constitutes an eligible modification to an EPS facility: 1. A change that would increase the facility’s annual production in respect of a product associated with an industrial activity. 2. A change that would result in an industrial activity that was not engaged in at the facility before the change being engaged in at the facility. 3. A change that would result in a product from an industrial activity that was not produced at the facility before the change being produced at the facility. O. Reg. 562/22, s. 3 (8). (5) Despite subsection (4), a change does not constitute an eligible modification if the primary change that constitutes the modification is the maintenance, repair or replacement of existing equipment at the facility. O. Reg. 562/22, s. 3 (8). (6) Despite subsection (4), if the only change being made to the facility is a change described in paragraph 1 of that subsection, the change does not constitute an eligible modification unless the following criteria are met: 1. The annual emissions intensity after the change is substantially complete in respect of at least one of the following products is less than or equal to the annual emissions intensity in respect of that product before the change: i. A product whose production, A. has made the greatest contribution to the facility’s revenue in a year prior to the year in which the change is substantially complete, or B. is projected to make the greatest contribution to the facility’s revenue in any year during the 10-year period commencing with the year in which the change is substantially complete. ii. A product whose production, A. has resulted in the highest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions from the facility in a year prior to the year in which the change is substantially complete, or B. is projected to result in the highest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions from the facility in any year during the 10-year period commencing with the year in which the change is substantially complete. 2. The product mentioned in paragraph 1, i. was produced at the facility before the change, and ii. will continue to be produced at the facility after the change is substantially complete. O. Reg. 562/22, s. 3 (8). (7) The first compliance period in respect of a registration for a facility is determined as follows: 1. If the facility was registered or required to be registered under this Regulation on or before December 31, 2021, the first compliance period is 2022. 2. If a notice of registration of a person as a registered emitter is issued under subsection 64 (2) of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (Canada) by the Minister of National Revenue and the effective date set out in the notice is a date in the year following registration under this Regulation, the first compliance period is the year following registration under this Regulation. 3. If the facility is registered under paragraph 3 of subsection 4 (1), the first compliance period is the third year after the end of the first year in which the facility produces a product from an industrial activity. However, this paragraph does not apply if the primary activity engaged in at the facility is an activity set out in item 38 (Generating electricity using fossil fuels) of Schedule 2. 4. In all other cases, the first compliance period is the year in which the facility is registered or is required to be registered, whichever is earlier. O. Reg. 562/22, s. 3 (8). (8) If a registration is continued under section 6, the first compliance period in respect of the continued registration is the first compliance period determined under subsection (7) of this section in respect of the initial registration. O. Reg. 562/22, s. 3 (8). (9) A reference in this Regulation to a person who registered a facility includes, (a) a person who applied to register a facility and received written confirmation of the registration under section 5; and (b) a person who received written confirmation that a registration was continued under subsection 6 (5).

The annual emissions of each greenhouse gas associated with each industrial activity engaged in at the facility, expressed in tonnes. iv. The annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with each industrial activity engaged in at the facility, expressed in tonnes of CO2e. 2. If the report is in respect of paragraph 2 of subsection (1), i. confirmation that the primary change constituting the eligible modification is not a change described in subsection 1 (5), and ii. if the change meets the criteria in subsection 1 (6), the licensed engineering practitioner’s estimates of the annual emissions intensity in respect of at least one of the products described in paragraph 1 of that subsection before the eligible modification and the projected annual emissions intensity in respect of the same product after the eligible modification. 3. A list of all units, processes, activities and operations that were taken into account in quantifying or estimating greenhouse gas emissions. 4. The details of the calculations, assumptions, material usage, level of production, energy usage and processes that informed the estimates of emissions and emissions intensities. 5. Such other information as the Director may specify in respect of the estimates. O. Reg. 562/22, s. 5.

The estimates of greenhouse gas emissions must be made for each greenhouse gas set out in Schedule 1 to the Reporting Regulation, and the amount of CO2e, if applicable, must be determined by applying the global warming potential for each gas set out in Column 5 of that Schedule. 2. The expected annual production amount of each product in respect of each industrial activity engaged in at the facility must be obtained from the owner or operator of the facility. 3. All emissions estimates and expected values must be based on calculations that are consistent with one or more of the following: i. The document published by the Ministry and available from the Ministry, entitled “Guideline for Quantification, Reporting and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions”, as amended from time to time. ii.
