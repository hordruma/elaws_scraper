R.S.O. 1990, c. M.62, s. 139 (1); 1994, c. 27, s. 111 (2, 3).

Allowances (2) The School Board may pay, (a) to each member of the School Board an allowance in such amount as is determined by the School Board for members; (b) to each alternate member of the School Board an allowance in such amount as is determined by the School Board for alternate members; and (c) to the chair of the School Board, in addition to the allowance under clause (a) or (b), an allowance in such amount as is determined by the School Board for the chair.

Apportionment by School Board (7) When the School Board submits its estimates for school purposes to the Metropolitan Council, the School Board shall also provide the Metropolitan Council with a statement of the portions of the amount required that the School Board has determined shall be apportioned to each area municipality in accordance with subsection (11). Reduction of apportionment (8) Where the estimates for school purposes of a board of education in the Metropolitan Area that are approved in whole or in part by the School Board have been reduced in accordance with clause 155 (1) (b) by the application of a surplus, the School Board shall reduce the apportionment for school purposes to the area municipality in which the board of education has jurisdiction in an amount computed in accordance with subsection (9). 1994, c. 27, s. 111 (4). Rules for reduction (9) The reduction of an apportionment under subsection (8) in relation to a specific year shall be calculated as follows: 1. Compute for the preceding year the proportion that the total rateable property for school purposes, other than separate school purposes, in the area municipality was of the total rateable property in relation to the Metropolitan Area. 2. Compute in respect of the preceding year the proportion that the estimates of the board of education approved by the School Board for school purposes was of the aggregate of the estimates of all of the boards of education approved by the School Board. 3. Divide the proportion computed under paragraph 1 by the proportion computed under paragraph 2. 4. Where the quotient computed under paragraph 3 is equal to or greater than one, the apportionment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the surplus mentioned in subsection (8). 5. Where the quotient computed under paragraph 3 is less than one, the apportionment shall be reduced by an amount computed by multiplying the surplus mentioned in subsection (8) by the quotient computed under paragraph 3. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.62, s. 139 (9); 1994, c. 27, s. 111 (5). Increase of apportionment (10) Where the estimates for school purposes of a board of education in the Metropolitan Area provide for a deficit of a previous year and the estimates have been approved by the School Board in whole or in part, the School Board shall increase the apportionment that would otherwise be made for school purposes to the area municipality in which the board of education has jurisdiction by an amount that does not exceed the amount of the deficit and, in determining the amount of the increase in the apportionment, the School Board shall give consideration to any circumstances that, in the opinion of the School Board, contributed to the size of the deficit and could not reasonably have been foreseen. Calculation of apportionment (11) For the purpose of determining the apportionment to the area municipalities in the Metropolitan Area of the sums required for school purposes, the School Board shall remove from the amount of its estimates submitted for school purposes to the Metropolitan Council under clause (1) (g) the portions of the surpluses to be used for reducing apportionments under subsection (8) and the portions of the deficits to be used for increasing apportionments under subsection (10) and shall apportion the remainder of the amount of the estimates for school purposes in the proportion that the total rateable property for school purposes, other than separate school purposes, in respect of each area municipality bears to the total rateable property in the Metropolitan Area for school purposes, other than separate school purposes, and each apportionment so determined shall then be adjusted by the School Board by reduction under subsection (8) or increase under subsection (10). 1994, c. 27, s. 111 (6). Transfer of balance of surplus (12) Every board of education shall transfer to the School Board an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the surplus of the board of education mentioned in clause 155 (1) (b) and an amount equal to the amount computed in respect of the board of education under subsection (9). Application of amount transferred (13) The School Board shall apply amounts transferred to it under subsection (12) to reduce the estimates submitted by it to the Metropolitan Council.

Buildings used for other purposes (3) Where any part of a building mentioned in subsection (2) is used by the area municipality or a local board thereof for purposes other than public welfare purposes, the Metropolitan Council may, (a) where practicable, assume only the part of the building and land appurtenant thereto used for public welfare purposes; or (b) assume the whole building and land appurtenant thereto, and enter into an agreement with the area municipality or a local board thereof for the use of a part of the land or building by such area municipality or local board on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon.

The sheriff shall then in like manner as rates are struck for general municipal purposes within each area municipality strike a rate sufficient in the dollar to cover its share of the amount due from the execution and in determining such amount he or she may make such addition to the same as the sheriff considers sufficient to cover its share of the interest up to the time when the rate will probably be available and his or her own fees and poundage. 4.
