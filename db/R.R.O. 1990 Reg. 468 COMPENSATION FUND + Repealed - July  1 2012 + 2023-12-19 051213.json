(2) A claim for payment out of the fund may only be made, (a) within six months of the event giving rise to the claim in the case of a claim under clause (1) (a), (b) or (d); or (b) within six months of the date that the person could have reasonably been expected to have known that payment was due in the case of a claim under clause (1) (c).

(5) Despite subsection (2), if circumstances warrant it, the Committee may grant an extension of time for making a claim against the Fund and the decision of the Committee as to any such extension is final and not subject to review. (6) The Committee shall determine the eligibility and the amount of any claim made by a claimant and shall direct the Trustee to pay any claim or any part thereof that meets the requirements of this Regulation and, subject to section 11, the decision of the Committee is final.
