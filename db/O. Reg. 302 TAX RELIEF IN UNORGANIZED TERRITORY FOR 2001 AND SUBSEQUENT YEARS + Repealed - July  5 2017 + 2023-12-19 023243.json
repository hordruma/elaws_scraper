(2) If the total amount of taxes for school purposes for 2001 for an eligible property before the application of the phase-in exceeds the total amount of taxes for school purposes for 2000 for the property, the maximum amount of the tax increase to be phased in is the amount of the difference.  O. Reg. 3/02, s. 4 (2). (3) If the total amount of taxes for school purposes for 2000 for an eligible property exceeds the total amount of taxes for school purposes for 2001 for the property, before the application of the phase-in, the maximum amount of the tax decrease to be phased in is the amount of the difference.  O. Reg. 3/02, s. 4 (3). (4) For the purposes of this section, the total amount of taxes for school purposes for 2000 for an eligible property is the amount determined under the following rules: 1. If paragraphs 2 and 3 do not apply, the amount of the taxes for school purposes for 2000 for the property is the amount of taxes levied on the property for 2000. 2. If a supplementary assessment or change in classification was made under section 34 of the Assessment Act during 2000, or if an assessment or change in classification could have been made under section 34 of that Act and the appropriate change is made to the assessment roll for taxation in 2001, the amount of the taxes for school purposes for 2000 for the property is the amount that would have been determined for 2000 if the increase in the assessment or change in classification, as the case may be, had applied to the property for 2000. 3. If any taxes for school purposes for 2000 for the property are cancelled, reduced or refunded under section 442 of the Municipal Act on an application under clause 442 (1) (a), (a.1), (c) or (f) of that Act or under section 443 of that Act, recalculate the amount of taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the event that caused the cancellation, reduction or refund had occurred on January 1, 2000.  O. Reg. 3/02, s. 4 (4). (5) The following rules apply to the phase-in of a tax increase described in subsection (2): 1. The tax increase is subtracted from the amount of taxes for 2001 that would be determined before the application of this section. 2. The amount of the increase to be included in the taxes for 2001, as determined under paragraph 3, is added to the amount determined under paragraph 1, to determine the amount of taxes payable for 2001. 3. The amount of the increase to be included in the taxes for 2001 is the greater of, i. 50 per cent of the increase, and ii. the lesser of $30 and the amount necessary to fully phase in the increase.  O. Reg. 3/02, s. 4 (5). (6) The following rules apply to the phase-in of a tax decrease described in subsection (3): 1. The tax decrease is added to the amount of taxes for 2001 that would be determined before the application of this section. 2. Subject to paragraph 3, the amount of the decrease to be phased in for 2001 is the greater of the threshold determined under paragraph 4 and 50 per cent of the amount of the decrease. 3. The amount of the decrease phased in for 2001 must not exceed the amount necessary to fully phase in the decrease. 4.

If, in respect of the property, the 1999 assessment roll for taxation in 2000 included an amount in the sub-class for vacant units and excess land prescribed under the Assessment Act, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the property did not contain any vacant units. 3. If a supplementary assessment or change in classification is made under section 34 of the Assessment Act during 2000 or if an assessment or change in classification could have been made under section 34 of that Act and the appropriate change is made on the assessment roll for taxation in 2001, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the increase in the assessment or change in classification, as the case may be, had applied to the property for all of 2000. 4. If the assessment of a property whose classification is in the sub-class for vacant land on the assessment roll for taxation in 2001 increases as a result of an improvement to that property during 2000 and if no portion of any building on the property begins to be used for any purpose during 2000, recalculate the taxes determined under paragraph 1 as if the increase in the assessment had applied to the property for all of 2000. 5.

O. Reg. 3/02, s. 21 (7). (8) Despite subsection (7), if an additional assessment is made for the 2000 taxation year in relation to an improvement and, in relation to the same improvement, an additional assessment is made for the 2001 taxation year under section 34 of the Assessment Act, subsection (7) does not apply with respect to the additional assessment for the 2001 taxation year.  O. Reg. 3/02, s. 21 (8).

Divide the amount in paragraph 1 by the amount in paragraph 2. 4. Multiply the quotient in paragraph 3 by 100. 5. Add the amounts in paragraphs 1 and 2. 6. Divide the amount in paragraph 2 by the amount in paragraph 5. 7. Multiply the quotient determined in paragraph 6 by the assessment on the assessment roll for taxation in 2001. 8.
