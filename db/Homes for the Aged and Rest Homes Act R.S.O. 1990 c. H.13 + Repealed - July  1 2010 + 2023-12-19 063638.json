Every resident has the right to be informed in writing of any law, rule or policy affecting the operation of the home and of the procedures for initiating complaints. 17. Every resident has the right to manage his or her own financial affairs if the resident is able to do so and, if the resident’s financial affairs are managed by the home, to receive a quarterly accounting of any transactions undertaken on his or her behalf and to be assured that the resident’s property is managed solely on the resident’s behalf. 18. Every resident has the right to live in a safe and clean environment. 19. Every resident has the right to be given access to protected areas outside the home in order to enjoy outdoor activity, unless the physical setting makes this impossible. 1993, c. 2, s. 14; 1999, c. 6, s. 27 (1); 2004, c. 3, Sched.
