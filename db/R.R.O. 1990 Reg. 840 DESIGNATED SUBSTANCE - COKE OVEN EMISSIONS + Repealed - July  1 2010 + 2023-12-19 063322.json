R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 840, s. 18. SCHEDULE 1 The time-weighted average exposure of a worker to coke oven emissions shall be calculated for a forty-hour week and an eight-hour day as follows: 1. The average concentrations of coke oven emissions to which a worker is exposed shall be determined from analyses of air samples representative of the exposure of the worker to coke oven emissions during work operations as set out in the Code mentioned in section 11. 2. The results of the analyses are the concentrations expressed as BSFTPM of coke oven emissions in milligrams per cubic metre of air. 3. The concentrations shall be multiplied by the time in hours to which the worker is taken to be exposed to such concentrations. 4. The weekly exposure shall be calculated as follows: C1T1 + C2T2 +...+ CnTn = cumulative weekly exposure where, C1 is the concentration found in an air sample, and T1 is the total time in hours to which the worker is taken to be exposed to concentration C1 in a week. 5. The weekly time-weighted average exposure shall be calculated by dividing the cumulative weekly exposure by 40. 6. The daily exposure shall be calculated as follows: C1T1 + C2T2 +...+ CnTn = cumulative daily exposure where, C1 is the concentration found in an air sample, and T1 is the total time in hours to which the worker is taken to be exposed to concentration C1 in a day. 7. The daily time-weighted average exposure shall be calculated by dividing the cumulative daily exposure by 8. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 840, Sched. 1. SCHEDULE 2 The following controls, practices and facilities shall be included in a coke oven emissions control program pursuant to clause 7 (2) (a) of this Regulation: I. Engineering Controls 1. Charging (1) The charging operation shall be conducted in one of the following ways: 1. Stage charging. 2. Sequential charging. 3. Pipeline charging of preheated coal. 4. Chain conveyor charging of preheated coal. (2) During the charging operation, provision shall be made for the following engineering controls: 1. Drafting from two or more points of the oven chamber by, (i) a double collecting main; (ii) a jumper pipe on the larry car or oven top; or (iii) a separate charging main attached to the larry car. 2. A functional steam aspiration system. 3. Adjustable volumetric controls on the larry car hoppers to provide the appropriate quantity of coal to be charged so as to ensure an adequate free space for gas evacuation. 4. Stainless steel hopper liners, mechanical vibrators or pneumatic stimulators to allow the proper flow of coal into the oven chamber. 5. Gooseneck and standpipe cleaners as is appropriate in the circumstances. 6. A leveller bar seal to the chuck door opening. 7. Carbon cutter or compressed air roof decarbonization on the pusher ram. 2. Coking (1) During the coking operation, provision shall be made for the following engineering controls: 1. Backpressure control on each battery to ensure uniform collector main pressure. 2. An adequate number of spare doors readily available and in good condition for the replacement of leaking doors when such replacement is appropriate in the circumstances. 3. Chuck door gaskets or sealing material to be used when such use is appropriate in the circumstances. II. Work Practices 1. Charging (1) During the charging operation, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Inspection and cleaning of goosenecks and standpipes prior to each charge to provide an appropriate open area for the passage of gases from the oven to the collecting main. 2. Inspection and, when appropriate in the circumstances, the removal of roof carbon so as to ensure an adequate free space above the coal charge to allow for the passage of gases to the off-take system. 3. Routine inspection of the steam aspiration system. 4. Routine inspection of the flushing liquor sprays. 5. Cleaning and sealing of standpipe caps as is appropriate in the circumstances. 6. Filling of the larry car hoppers with an appropriate quantity of coal. 7. Alignment of the larry car at the oven so that the drop sleeves fit tightly over the charging holes. 8. Charging of the coal into the oven using the proper sequence for the type of charging operation utilized. 9. The aspiration system to be turned off only when the charging holes have been closed. 2. Coking (1) During the coking operation, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Repair, replacement or adjustment of oven doors and chuck doors, as well as maintenance of door jambs, as is appropriate in the circumstances, to provide a gas tight fit. 2. Clean oven doors, chuck doors and door jambs between each coking cycle to provide a gas tight fit. 3. An inspection system and a corrective action program to control door and top side emissions. 3. Pushing (1) During the pushing operation, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Coke spillage to be cleaned up after each push. 2. Coal spillage on the bench to be collected in the bin on the pusher machine. 3. Coal charge to be heated as uniformly as possible for the set time period before pushing. 4. Heating maintenance to be performed to provide heating which is as uniform as possible. 4. Maintenance and Repair (1) In order to ensure adequate maintenance and repair, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Regular inspection of all engineering controls which have been installed to decrease coke oven emissions and effective implementation of all necessary repairs thereto. 2. Regular inspection of battery function and prompt and effective implementation of necessary repairs thereto. III. Hygiene Facilities (1) Provision shall be made for the following hygiene facilities: 1. Positive pressure, temperature controlled, filtered air for the larry car, pusher machine, door machine and quench car cabs. 2.
