(7) For the purposes of the definition of “W” in subsection (4), the designated percentage of a corporation’s share for a taxation year of the adjusted resource profits of a partnership for a fiscal period ending in the year is determined as follows: 1. The corporation’s designated percentage is 100 per cent if the corporation holds a direct interest in and is a majority interest partner of the partnership at the end of the fiscal period and does not have, through that partnership, an indirect interest in another partnership, other than, i. a partnership of which the corporation is a majority interest partner at any time in the fiscal period, or ii. a partnership that carries on no resource activity as defined in subsection 1204 (6) of the regulations made under the Income Tax Act (Canada). 2. If the fiscal period begins before January 1, 2007 and the corporation holds a direct interest in the partnership at the end of the fiscal period but is not a majority interest partner at that time, the corporation’s designated percentage is the sum of the following percentages: i. 100 per cent multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the fiscal period that are before January 1, 2003 to the total number of days in the fiscal period. ii. 90 per cent multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the fiscal period that are after December 31, 2002 and before January 1, 2004 to the total number of days in the fiscal period. iii. 75 per cent multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the fiscal period that are after December 31, 2003 and before January 1, 2005 to the total number of days in the fiscal period. iv. 65 per cent multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the fiscal period that are after December 31, 2004 and before January 1, 2006 to the total number of days in the fiscal period. v. 35 per cent multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the fiscal period that are after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2007 to the total number of days in the fiscal period.  O. Reg. 60/06, s. 3 (7). (8) For greater certainty, nothing in subparagraph 2 i of subsection (6) affects the nature or extent of any partner’s interest in any partnership for the purposes of, (a) the definition of “W” in subsection (4); or (b) paragraph 4 of subsection (5).

(2) For the purposes of the Act, a taxpayer may include the eligible cost of a qualifying intellectual property in the capital cost of a depreciable property of Class 12, but not Class 14 or 44 of Schedule II to the Federal Regulations, (a) if the property is acquired after August 31, 1997 by the taxpayer in an intellectual property transfer carried out under the terms of a contract that was entered into by the taxpayer after May 6, 1997; (b) if the property is first used by the taxpayer in carrying on the taxpayer’s business within a reasonable time following acquisition and continues to be used during the entire period of time in which the innovation or invention for which the property was acquired is used in carrying on the taxpayer’s business; and (c) if the cost of the property is included by the taxpayer, for the purposes of the Federal Act, (i) in Class 14 or 44 of Schedule II to the Federal Regulations, or (ii) in computing its eligible capital expenditures for purposes of that Act. (3) A separate class is prescribed in respect of each qualifying intellectual property whose undepreciated capital cost is included in Class 12 under this section. (4) Despite subsection (2), the total of all amounts included in a taxation year by a taxpayer in the capital cost of depreciable properties whose undepreciated capital cost is included in Class 12 under this section shall not exceed the taxpayer’s expenditure limit for that year. (5) If a taxpayer’s expenditure limit for a year is less than the amount that would otherwise be added to the undepreciated capital cost in respect of a qualifying intellectual property whose undepreciated capital cost is included in Class 12 under this section, the amount of the difference may be included in the same Class to Schedule II to the Federal Regulations or in the taxpayer’s eligible capital expenditures for the purposes of the Act, as applicable, depending on the treatment by the taxpayer of the cost of the property for the purposes of the Federal Act. (6) A taxpayer’s expenditure limit for a taxation year is $20 million if the taxpayer is not associated at any time in the year with any other taxpayer. (7) If a taxpayer is associated in a taxation year with another taxpayer, the taxpayer’s expenditure limit is determined in accordance with the following rules: 1. If all of the taxpayers that are associated with each other in the taxation year have filed with the Minister an agreement in a form acceptable to the Minister under which, for the purposes of this section, they allocate an amount to one or more of them for the taxation year, and the total of all amounts allocated to one or more of them does not exceed $20 million, the expenditure limit for the year of each taxpayer shall be, subject to paragraph 4 and subsections (8) and (9), the amount allocated to it. 2. If the Minister notifies in writing any of the taxpayers that are associated with each other in a taxation year that an agreement referred to in paragraph 1 is required to be filed and no agreement is filed within 30 days after the notification is sent by the Minister, i. the Minister may, for the purposes of this section, allocate an amount to each of the taxpayers, and the total of all amounts allocated by the Minister to the taxpayers shall not exceed $20 million, and ii. except as otherwise provided in paragraph 4 or subsection (8) or (9), the expenditure limit for the year of each of the taxpayers is the amount allocated by the Minister to it. 3. If no agreement referred to in paragraph 1 is filed by the taxpayers with the Minister, and the Minister does not make an allocation under paragraph 2, the expenditure limit of each of the taxpayers for the taxation year shall be deemed to be nil. 4. If a taxpayer (in this paragraph referred to as the “first taxpayer”) has more than one taxation year ending in the same calendar year and it is associated in two or more of those taxation years with another taxpayer that has a taxation year ending in that calendar year, the expenditure limit of the first taxpayer for each taxation year that ends in the calendar year, that is a taxation year in which it is associated with the other taxpayer and that is a taxation year that ends after its first taxation year ending in that calendar year, shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of, i. its expenditure limit as otherwise determined under paragraph 1, 2 or 3 for its first taxation year ending in the calendar year, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the taxation year to 365, and ii. its expenditure limit as otherwise determined under paragraph 1, 2 or 3 for the particular taxation year ending in the calendar year, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the taxation year to 365. (8) Despite subsections (6) and (7), if a taxpayer has a taxation year that is less than 51 weeks and paragraph 4 of subsection (7) does not apply, the taxpayer’s expenditure limit for the taxation year shall be the amount otherwise determined under this section, before the application of the rule in subsection (9) if it applies, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the taxation year to 365. (9) Despite subsections (6) and (7), if a taxpayer’s taxation year commences before May 7 1997, its expenditure limit for the taxation year shall not exceed the amount otherwise determined under this section, multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the year ending after May 6, 1997 to the total days in the taxation year. (10) Taxpayers shall be deemed to be associated with each other in a taxation year for the purposes of determining their expenditure limits for the year if on the application of the following rules they would be associated in the taxation year under section 256 of the Federal Act: 1. A partnership shall be deemed to be a corporation having only one class of issued shares which have full voting rights under all circumstances, and each member of the partnership shall be deemed to own the proportion of the number of issued shares of the capital stock of the corporation as that member’s proportionate share of the income or loss of the partnership. 2. Two partnerships shall be deemed to be associated if each member of one partnership is a member of the other partnership or is related to at least one member of the other partnership. 3. A taxpayer that is deemed to be associated with another taxpayer shall be deemed to be associated with every corporation and partnership that is deemed to be associated with the other taxpayer.
