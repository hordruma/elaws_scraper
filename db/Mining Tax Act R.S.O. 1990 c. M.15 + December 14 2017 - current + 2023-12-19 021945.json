R.S.O. 1990, c. M.15, s. 3 (3).

The only amounts deductible under clause (5) (g) are exploration and development expenditures made or incurred in respect of the remote mine for a purpose described in clause (b) or (c) of the definition of “exploration and development expenditures” in subsection 1 (1). 2. The amount deductible under clause (5) (h) is determined without reference to clause (12) (c). 3. No amount is deductible under clause (5) (l). 4.

Same (12.1) The following rules apply if an operator has an interest in more than one mine during a taxation year and at least one of the mines is a remote mine: 1. The allowance for depreciation deductible by the operator in calculating the amount of the operator’s profit for a taxation year under subsection (5) or (8) or loss for the taxation year under subsection (9) or (10) is the amount that would be the operator’s allowance for depreciation for the taxation year under subsection (12) in respect of only the depreciable property that is reasonably related to the mine or mines in respect of which the calculation is made under subsection (5), (8), (9) or (10). 2. The total of all amounts deducted as an allowance for depreciation for a taxation year in respect of all mines in which the operator has an interest must not exceed the operator’s allowance for depreciation for the taxation year, as determined under subsection (12).  2001, c. 23, s. 151 (3). Exploration and development expenditures (13) For the purposes of clause (5) (g), the maximum amount deductible by an operator for a taxation year in respect of exploration and development expenditures is the aggregate of, (a) exploration and development expenditures incurred in Ontario by the operator to the extent that such expenditures qualified as exploration and development expenditures under this Act at the time they were incurred; and (b) exploration and development expenditures incurred by another person to the extent that, (i) such expenditures qualified as exploration and development expenditures under this Act at the time they were incurred by the other person, and (ii) such expenditures qualify to be renounced and have been renounced by the other person in favour of the operator under subdivision e of Division B of Part I of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and have not been deducted by the other person under this Act or in the calculation of taxable income of the other person under Part I of the Income Tax Act (Canada), less the aggregate of, (c) all amounts deducted under this Act by the operator in any previous taxation year in respect of exploration and development expenditures; (d) all amounts allowed as eligible exploration expenses under the Ontario Mineral Exploration Program Act; (e) the amount of any assistance or benefit from a government, municipality or other public authority in respect thereto, including any grant, subsidy, forgivable loan, investment allowance or other form of assistance or benefit received or receivable by the operator, other than a grant or tax credit under the Ontario Mineral Exploration Program Act; and (f) all exploration and development expenditures that qualify to be renounced and have been renounced by the operator in favour of another person under subdivision e of Division B of Part I of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

Exempt amount (2) An operator’s exempt amount for a taxation year for a mine is the lesser of, (a) the operator’s profit, if any, from the new mine or from the major expansion of the existing mine, for the portion of the exempt period that is both within the taxation year and after the 30th day of April, 1991; or (b) the amount, if any, by which the operator’s exemption limit for the mine exceeds the aggregate of all amounts, if any, each of which is an amount excluded under subsection (1) from the operator’s profit for a previous taxation year.  1992, c. 4, s. 2. Determination of profit (3) The operator’s profit from the new mine or from the major expansion of the existing mine shall be determined under subsection 3 (5) as if the operator’s interest in the new mine or in the major expansion is the only interest the operator had in a mine during the taxation year provided that, (a) the allowance for depreciation under clause 3 (5) (h) shall be the amount equal to the aggregate of the maximum amounts calculated in accordance with clauses 3 (12) (a) and (b), subject to clauses 3 (12) (d) and (e) and subsection 3 (21); and (b) no amount shall be deducted in respect of the allowance for depreciation of the operator calculated under clause 3 (12) (c) in respect of depreciable property that can reasonably be considered to be used in connection with the new mine or the major expansion of the existing mine.  1992, c. 4, s. 2. Transitional adjustment (4) If the operator’s taxation year commences before the lst day of May, 1991, the operator may exclude from profit, in addition to any amount determined under subsection (2) for the taxation year, an amount not exceeding the operator’s profit, if any, from the new mine or the major expansion of the existing mine for the portion of the exempt period that is both within the taxation year and before the 1st day of May, 1991.  1992, c. 4, s. 2. Prorating depreciation allowance (5) If only part of the operator’s taxation year is within an exempt period in respect of a new mine or major expansion, the amount of the operator’s allowance for depreciation required to be deducted in determining the operator’s profit from the mine or major expansion shall be equal to the proportion of the allowance for depreciation determined under clause (3) (a) that the number of days during the portion of the exempt period in the taxation year is of the total number of days in the taxation year.  1992, c. 4, s. 2. More than one operator (6) If more than one operator is entitled to elect under subsection (1) to exclude an amount from profit in respect of the same mine, the operators shall determine among themselves the exemption limit of each of them, but in no case shall the total of the operators’ exemption limits for the mine exceed $10,000,000 less the total of all amounts, if any, each of which is an amount that has been excluded under subsection (1) in respect of the mine from the profit of a person who is no longer an operator of the mine.  1992, c. 4, s. 2. Interpretation (7) For the purposes of this section, (a) an operator’s exemption limit for a mine is, (i) if there have been no other operators of the mine after the 30th day of April, 1991, $10,000,000, (ii) if there are or have been other operators of the mine after the 30th day of April, 1991, $10,000,000 less the aggregate of, (A) all amounts, if any, each of which is an amount that was excluded from profit in respect of the mine under subsection (1) by a person who is no longer an operator of the mine, and (B) all amounts, each of which is the amount of an exemption limit allocated to another operator of the mine in a determination made under subsection (6); (b) the exempt period, in respect of a new mine or a major expansion of an existing mine, is the thirty-six month period commencing with the month when the new mine or the major expansion comes into production in reasonable commercial quantities; (c) a new mine shall be deemed to come into production in reasonable commercial quantities on the first day of the month when an operator of the new mine first becomes entitled to receive proceeds from the output of the mine; and (d) a major expansion of an existing mine shall be deemed to come into production in reasonable commercial quantities on the first day when the rate of production of mineral substances from the expanded mine exceeds by at least 30 per cent the average daily rate of production of mineral substances from the mine during each of the five calendar years ending immediately before the calendar year in which the first outlay was made to expand the mine.  1992, c. 4, s. 2. Loss (8) This section does not apply in respect of a new mine or a major expansion of an existing mine if a determination under this section of the operator’s profit from the new mine or the major expansion produces a loss with respect to the portion of the exempt period within the taxation year for which the determination was made.  1992, c. 4, s. 2.
