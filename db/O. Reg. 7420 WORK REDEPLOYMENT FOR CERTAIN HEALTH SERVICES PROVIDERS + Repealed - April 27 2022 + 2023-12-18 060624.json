(“maison de retraite”) 2. Health service providers shall and are authorized to take, with respect to work deployment and staffing, any reasonably necessary measure to respond to, prevent and alleviate the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) (the “Virus”) for patients, including, for greater certainty, by redeploying staff to another health service provider. 2.1 Despite any other statute, regulation, order, policy, arrangement or agreement, including a collective agreement, health service providers are authorized to assist long-term care homes including, without limitation, by providing assessments in relation to a long-term care home’s infection prevention and control program, by providing clinical supervision within a long-term care home and by providing nursing and personal support services, including assistance with feeding, to residents of a long-term care home. 2.1.1 Despite any other statute, regulation, order, policy, arrangement or agreement, including a collective agreement, health service providers are authorized to assist retirement homes including, without limitation, by providing assessments in relation to a retirement home’s infection prevention and control program, by providing clinical supervision within a retirement home and by providing nursing and personal support services, including assistance with feeding, to residents of a retirement home. 2.2 In the circumstances described in paragraphs 2 to 2.1.1, the following rules apply: i. Staff of a health service provider who are deployed to another health service provider or who provide assistance within a long-term care home or retirement home remain staff of the deploying health service provider. ii.

The deploying health service provider shall not, by virtue of deploying staff or providing assistance, be considered to have sold a part of its business to the receiving health services provider, the receiving long-term care home or the receiving retirement home, as the case may be, for the purposes of section 69 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995. 3. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 2, and despite any other statute, regulation, order, policy, arrangement or agreement, including a collective agreement, health service providers shall and are authorized to do the following: i.
