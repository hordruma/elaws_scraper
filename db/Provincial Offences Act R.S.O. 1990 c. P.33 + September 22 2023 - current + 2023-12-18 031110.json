Limit (17) The term of imprisonment shall not exceed the greater of, (a)  ninety days; and (b)  half of the maximum number of days of imprisonment that may be imposed on conviction of the offence that the person who has defaulted was convicted of.  1993, c. 31, s. 1 (26). Effect of payments (18) Subject to subsection (19), a payment in respect of the fine in default that is made after a warrant is issued under subsection (14) shall result in a reduction of the term of imprisonment by the number of days that is in the same proportion to the term as the payment is to the amount in default.  1993, c. 31, s. 1 (26). Restriction (19) A payment that is less than the amount outstanding on the fine shall not result in a reduction of the term of imprisonment unless it is an amount that would reduce the term by a number of days that is a whole number.  1993, c. 31, s. 1 (26). Exceptions (20) Subsections (6) to (19) do not apply if, (a)  the person who has defaulted is less than eighteen years old; or (b)  the fine was imposed on conviction of an offence under subsection 31 (1) or 41 (1) of the Liquor Licence and Control Act, 2019.  1993, c. 31, s. 1 (26); 2019, c. 15, Sched. 22, s. 101.
