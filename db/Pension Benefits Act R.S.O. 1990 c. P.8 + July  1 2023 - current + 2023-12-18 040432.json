Same (2.1) Subsection (2) does not require the successor pension plan to provide the same pension benefits and other benefits for the transferred members that were provided for them under the original pension plan.  2010, c. 9, s. 70 (2).

The administrators of the two pension plans must have agreed upon the manner of determining the amount of assets to be transferred, and the applicant must give the Chief Executive Officer notice of their agreement. 2.  If the pension benefits and other benefits to be provided under the successor pension plan for the transferred members are not the same as the pension benefits and other benefits provided for them under the original pension plan, the commuted value of the benefits provided for the transferred members under the successor pension plan must not be less than the commuted value of the benefits provided for them under the original pension plan, as adjusted for any payments made from the original pension plan to a prescribed retirement savings arrangement or directly to the transferred members in connection with the transfer of the assets. 3.  The commuted value of the benefits referred to in paragraph 2 is determined as of the effective date of the transfer of the assets. 4.
