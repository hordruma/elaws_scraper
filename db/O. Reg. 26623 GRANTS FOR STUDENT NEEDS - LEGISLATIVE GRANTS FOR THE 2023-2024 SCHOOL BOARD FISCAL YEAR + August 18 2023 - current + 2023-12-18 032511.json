The elementary school teacher qualification and experience amount. 2. The secondary school teacher qualification and experience amount. (2) The elementary school teacher qualification and experience amount is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 20, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who have the teacher qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a teacher qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a teacher qualification category of A2 or group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/group 2‑3. 2. For each cell in Table 20, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who are counted under paragraph 1 for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in the Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils. 5.

Multiply the result obtained under paragraph 6 by $5,478.45. 10. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 9 by the current fiscal year’s day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils, counting only pupils enrolled in grades 1 to 3. 11. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by $4,462.73. 12. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 11 by the current fiscal year’s day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils, counting only pupils enrolled in grades 4 to 8. 13. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by $231.65. 14. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 13 by the current fiscal year’s day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils, counting only pupils enrolled in grades 7 and 8. 15. Total the amounts determined under paragraphs 8, 10, 12 and 14. (3) The secondary school teacher qualification and experience amount is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 20, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who have the teacher qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a teacher qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a teacher qualification category of A2 or group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/group 2‑3. 2.

(5) The following rules apply to the counting of teachers for the purposes of subsection (3): 1. If a teacher is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31 of the current fiscal year to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils and is also assigned, as of that date, under section 17 of Regulation 298 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Operation of Schools — General) made under the Act, to spend part of his or her time acting as a consultant, co-ordinator or supervisor, the full-time equivalency for the teacher is determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31 of the current fiscal year for which the teacher is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils or to prepare for such instruction. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a count of hours is accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the total determined under subparagraph i by 5. 2. If a principal or vice-principal is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31 of the current fiscal year to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils, the principal or vice-principal is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section and his or her full-time equivalency as a teacher is determined as follows: i. Determine the average number of hours per day in the cycle that includes October 31 of the current fiscal year for which the principal or vice-principal is regularly scheduled, in accordance with the timetable, to provide instruction to pupils. For the purposes of this subsection, a count of hours is accurate to one decimal place. ii. Divide the number determined under subparagraph i by 5. 3. An occasional teacher who is assigned to provide instruction to pupils in a regular timetable in effect on October 31 of the current fiscal year is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section unless the teacher whom the occasional teacher replaces is included in determining the number of teachers employed by the board under subsection (4) and the board can reasonably expect the teacher to resume instructional duties with the board in the fiscal year. (6) The following rules apply in determining the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher: 1. The number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2023-2024 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number. 2. If the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, the number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher is deemed to be 10. 3. The number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be 10. (7) The following rules apply, as of October 31 of the current fiscal year, to determine the teacher qualification category of a teacher: 1. If a board uses an AEFO certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that AEFO certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 2. If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The teacher qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the teacher qualification category of a person is changed after October 31 of the current fiscal year and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the current fiscal year and October 31 of the current fiscal year, the changed teacher qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section.",
