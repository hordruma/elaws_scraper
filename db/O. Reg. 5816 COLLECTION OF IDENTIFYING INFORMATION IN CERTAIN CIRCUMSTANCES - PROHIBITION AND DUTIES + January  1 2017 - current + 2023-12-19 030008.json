(7) If, as a result of a detailed review under subsection (6), it is determined, with respect to identifying information included in a database under subsection (4), that section 5, 6 or 7 was not complied with, the identifying information shall be retained, subject to the procedures developed under section 13 in relation to paragraph 4 of subsection 12 (1), in a database under the control of the police force but access to such retained information shall be restricted in accordance with subsection (10). (8) The chief of police shall consider the results of the detailed reviews under subsection (6) and take such actions as the chief of police considers appropriate. (9) Access to identifying information shall be restricted in accordance with subsection (10) after the fifth anniversary of the date on which the information was first entered into a database under the control of the police force.
