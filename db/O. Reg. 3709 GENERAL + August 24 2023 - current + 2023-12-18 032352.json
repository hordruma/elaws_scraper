(4) A corporation’s adjusted resource profits for a taxation year for the purposes of subsection (3) is the amount, which may be a positive or negative amount, calculated using the formula, F + G – H in which, “F” is the amount of the corporation’s resource profits for the year, as determined under subsection (5), “G” is the sum of all amounts each of which is the corporation’s share for the year of the adjusted resource profits of a partnership, as determined under subsections (6) and (7), for a fiscal period of the partnership ending in the year, and “H” is the amount, if any, by which the sum of “I” and “J” exceeds the amount of “K” where, “I” is the sum of all amounts each of which is an amount, other than a production royalty or specified royalty included in the corporation’s gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations as a rental or royalty computed by reference to the amount or value of fossil fuel produced from a Canadian fossil fuel source, “J” is 50 per cent of all amounts in respect of specified royalties that are included in the corporation’s gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations, and “K” is the sum of all outlays and expenses that were made or incurred in respect of the amounts included in the calculation of “I”, to the extent the outlays and expenses were deducted in computing the corporation’s gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations. O. Reg. 37/09, s. 7 (4). (5) The amount of a corporation’s resource profits for a taxation year for the purposes of this section is the amount that would be determined in respect of the corporation for the year under subsection 1204 (1.1) of the Federal regulations, (a) if, in determining the corporation’s gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations, (i) no amount were included under paragraph 1204 (1) (a) of the Federal regulations, and (ii) no amount were included in the corporation’s income for the year from the processing in Canada of ore described in clause 1204 (1) (b) (iv) (A), (B) or (C) of the Federal regulations; (b) if references to a resource activity in subparagraph 1204 (1.1) (a) (iv), subclause 1204 (1.1) (a) (v) (A) (I) and clause 1204 (1.1) (a) (v) (B) of the Federal regulations were read as references to a resource activity other than an activity described in paragraph (d) of the definition of “resource activity” in subsection 1206 (1) of the Federal regulations; (c) if the corporation’s gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations and its resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1.1) of the Federal regulations were determined on the basis that, (i) no amount would be deductible in computing the corporation’s income for the year in respect of a rental or royalty paid or payable by the corporation and computed by reference to the amount or value of fossil fuel produced from a Canadian fossil fuel source, other than, (A) an amount in respect of an exempt rental or royalty, (B) an amount that is a production royalty, or (C) an amount paid or payable in respect of a specified royalty, (ii) no amount would be deductible in computing the corporation’s income for the year under paragraph 20 (1) (e), (e.1), (e.2) or (f) of the Federal Act or as, on account of or in lieu of, interest in respect of a debt owed by the corporation, (iii) no amount would be deductible in computing the corporation’s income under any of sections 65 to 66.7 of the Federal Act, subsection 17 (2) or (6) of the Income Tax Application Rules or section 29 of those Rules, and (iv) section 11.0.1, other than subsection 11.0.1 (4), and subsections 26 (4.1), (6) and (7) and 31 (1.2) of the Corporations Tax Act would apply in computing the corporation’s income for the year even though those provisions would not otherwise apply for the year; (d) if the corporation’s share of the income or loss of a partnership from any source were deemed to be nil; and (e) if each of subsections 1204 (1) and (1.1) of the Federal regulations were deemed to allow the computation of a negative amount if the sum of the amounts deducted under the subsection exceeded the sum of the amounts added under that subsection.  O. Reg. 37/09, s. 7 (5). (6) For the purposes of the definition of “G” in subsection (4), a corporation’s share for a taxation year of a particular partnership’s adjusted resource profits for a fiscal period ending in the year is determined as follows: 1. If the corporation does not hold a direct interest in the particular partnership at the end of the fiscal period, the corporation’s share of the partnership’s adjusted resource profits is deemed to be nil. 2. If the corporation holds a direct interest in the particular partnership at the end of the fiscal period, the corporation’s share of the partnership’s adjusted resource profits is the amount that may reasonably be considered to represent the corporation’s share of the partnership’s adjusted resource profits for the fiscal period, determined under subsection (4) as if, i. the particular partnership and every other partnership in which the corporation has an indirect interest through the particular partnership were corporations, each having a taxation year that is the same as its fiscal period, ii. subclause (5) (c) (iv) applied to the particular partnership, but only if the corporation is a majority interest partner in that partnership at the end of the fiscal period, iii. subclause (5) (c) (iv) applied to another partnership in which the corporation held an indirect interest through the particular partnership, but only if the corporation is a majority interest partner in the particular partnership at the end of the fiscal period and is a majority interest partner in the other partnership at any time in the fiscal period, and iv. this section were read without reference to subsection (7).  O. Reg. 37/09, s. 7 (6). (7) Despite subsection (6), a corporation’s share for a taxation year of the adjusted resource profits of a partnership for a fiscal period of the partnership ending in the year is deemed to be nil unless the corporation holds a direct interest in and is a majority interest partner of the partnership at the end of the fiscal period and does not have, through that partnership, an indirect interest in another partnership other than, (a) a partnership of which the corporation is a majority interest partner at any time in the fiscal period; or (b) a partnership that carries on no resource activity as defined in subsection 1204 (6) of the Federal regulations.  O. Reg. 37/09, s. 7 (7). (8) For greater certainty, nothing in subparagraph 2 i of subsection (6) affects the nature or extent of any partner’s interest in any partnership for the purposes of the definition of “G” in subsection (4) or for the purposes of clause (5) (d).

O. Reg. 37/09, s. 25 (1); O. Reg. 70/10, s. 4 (1). (2) Subject to subsections (2.1) and (6), the qualifying wage amount of a qualifying corporation for a taxation year with respect to an eligible production is the sum of, (a) the amount incurred by it during the taxation year on account of salaries and wages that are directly attributable to eligible computer animation and special effects activities carried out by the qualifying corporation in Ontario for the eligible production; and (b) if principal photography for the eligible production commenced after March 22, 2007, the amount, if any, of the eligible reimbursement of salaries and wages as determined under subsection (5) made by the qualifying corporation with respect to the eligible production for the taxation year.

The qualifying corporation and its parent have filed with the Minister an agreement that this subsection applies with respect to costs incurred for the eligible production. 3. The reimbursement is made by the qualifying corporation in the taxation year or within 60 days after the end of the taxation year. 4. If the amount is being determined for the purposes of clause (2) (b), the expenditure was incurred in a particular taxation year of the parent and would have been included in the qualifying wage amount of the qualifying corporation in respect of the eligible production for the particular taxation year under clause (2) (a), i. if the qualifying corporation had had that particular taxation year, and ii. if the expenditure had been incurred by the qualifying corporation for the same purpose as it was incurred by its parent and had been paid at the same time and to the same person or partnership as it was paid by its parent. 5. If the amount is being determined for the purpose of clause (3) (b), the expenditure was incurred in a particular taxation year of the parent and would have been included in the qualifying remuneration amount of the qualifying corporation in respect of the eligible production for the particular taxation year under clause (3) (a), i. if the qualifying corporation had had that particular taxation year, and ii. if the expenditure had been incurred by the qualifying corporation for the same purpose as it was incurred by its parent and had been paid at the same time and to the same person or partnership as it was paid by its parent.  O. Reg. 37/09, s. 25 (5). (6) An expenditure is not included under clause (2) (a) in the qualifying wage amount or under clause (3) (a) in the qualifying remuneration amount of a qualifying corporation for a taxation year with respect to an eligible production unless it meets all of the following conditions: 1. The expenditure is paid by the qualifying corporation no later than 60 days after the end of the year. 2. The expenditure was incurred for activities personally undertaken by an individual who was resident in Ontario at the end of the last calendar year ending before he or she undertook the activities. 3. In the case of the qualifying wage amount, the expenditure is paid to an employee of the qualifying corporation who reported to a permanent establishment of the qualifying corporation in Ontario where the eligible computer animation and special effects activities were undertaken for the eligible production. 4. In the case of the qualifying remuneration amount, the expenditure is paid for activities undertaken at a permanent establishment in Ontario of the qualifying corporation or of an individual, eligible partnership or corporation described in paragraph 1, 2, 3 or 4 of subsection (4). 5. The expenditure is not the subject of an agreement in respect of the eligible production referred to in paragraph 2 of subsection (5) between the qualifying corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the qualifying corporation.  O. Reg. 37/09, s. 25 (6); O. Reg. 70/10, s. 4 (5). (7) Despite paragraph 3 of subsection (5) and paragraph 1 of subsection (6), an expenditure that is excluded from the qualifying wage amount or qualifying remuneration amount of the qualifying corporation for a taxation year because it was not paid within 60 days after the end of the year may be included in the corporation’s qualifying wage amount or qualifying remuneration amount for a subsequent taxation year if it is paid within 60 days after the end of that subsequent taxation year.  O. Reg. 37/09, s. 25 (7). (8) For the purposes of this section, an eligible partnership is a partnership carrying on business in Canada whose members are all individuals. However, a partnership is not an eligible partnership in relation to a qualifying corporation if more than 50 per cent of the income of the partnership is allocable (or would be allocable, if it had income) to one or more members of the partnership who, (a) directly or indirectly control the qualifying corporation; or (b) are related to one or more persons who directly or indirectly control the qualifying corporation.
