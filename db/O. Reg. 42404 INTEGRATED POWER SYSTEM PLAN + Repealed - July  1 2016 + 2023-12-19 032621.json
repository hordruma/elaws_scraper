(1) In developing an integrated power system plan under subsection 25.30 (1) of the Act, the IESO shall follow directives that have been issued by the Minister under subsection 25.30 (2) of the Act and shall do the following: 1. Consult with consumers, distributors, generators, transmitters and other persons who have an interest in the electricity industry in order to ensure that their priorities and views are considered in the development of the plan. 2. Identify and develop innovative strategies to accelerate the implementation of conservation, energy efficiency and demand management measures. 3. Identify opportunities to use natural gas in high efficiency and high value applications in electricity generation. 4. Identify and develop innovative strategies to encourage and facilitate cost-effective measures for meeting overall system needs. 5. Consider competitive options when identifying and developing the strategies referred to in paragraph 4. 6. Identify factors that it must consider in determining that it is advisable to enter into procurement contracts under subsection 25.32 (1) of the Act. 7. Ensure that safety, environmental protection and environmental sustainability are considered in developing the plan. 8. Ensure that for each electricity project recommended in the plan that meets the criteria set out in subsection (2), the plan contains a sound rationale including, i. an analysis of the impact on the environment of the electricity project, and ii. an analysis of the impact on the environment of a reasonable range of alternatives to the electricity project.  O. Reg. 277/06, s. 1; O. Reg. 176/11, s. 1; O. Reg. 291/14, s. 2 (1). (2) For the purposes of paragraph 8 of subsection (1), the following are the criteria: 1. An environmental assessment of the electricity project under Part II of the Environmental Assessment Act  must be required. 2. The electricity project, based on the recommended date for completion of the project in the plan, will in the opinion of the IESO  require that an application for approval for an undertaking be made under the Environmental Assessment Act\r\nwithin five years after the approval of the plan by the Board.
