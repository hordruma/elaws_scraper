Consent No treatment without consent 4. A health practitioner who proposes a treatment to a person shall ensure that it is not administered unless, (a) he or she is of the opinion that the person is capable with respect to the treatment, and the person has given consent; or (b) he or she is of the opinion that the person is incapable with respect to the treatment, and another person has given consent in accordance with this Act. 1992, c.31, s.4.

            "content": "4. A health practitioner who proposes a treatment to a person shall ensure that it is not administered unless, (a) he or she is of the opinion that the person is capable with respect to the treatment, and the person has given consent; or (b) he or she is of the opinion that the person is incapable with respect to the treatment, and another person has given consent in accordance with this Act. 1992, c.31, s.4.

Refusal to meet (7) Subsection (5) does not apply if the person who has been found incapable refuses to meet with the rights adviser.

Treatment if rights adviser notified (11) A health practitioner who is required to ensure that a rights adviser be notified shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) the rights adviser advises the health practitioner that the person has received the explanation and has not indicated a wish to make an application to the Board under section 28; (b) the rights adviser advises the health practitioner that the person refused to meet with the rights adviser; (c) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the rights adviser was notified without an application being made to the Board under section 28; or (d) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of. Treatment if rights adviser not notified (12) If a person who has been found incapable with respect to a treatment by a health practitioner indicates to the health practitioner a wish to make an application to the Board under section 28 although notice to a rights adviser is not required, the health practitioner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the person indicated the wish without an application being made to the Board under section 28; or (b) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of.

Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24.

If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25.

Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act.

Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act.

If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25.

Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act.

Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility.

Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm.

Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3).

Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment.

Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility.

Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3).

Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be.

Same (6) Subject to subsection (7), if a person described in one of the paragraphs of subsection (1) is available, a person described in a later paragraph may give or refuse consent only if the one described in the earlier paragraph is not willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent or is himself or herself incapable with respect to the treatment. Family member present when treatment proposed (7) If a person described in paragraph 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of subsection (1) is present when the health practitioner proposes the treatment and no person described in an earlier paragraph is present, the person who is present may give or refuse consent on the incapable person’s behalf unless, (a) the person who is present has reason to believe that a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection (1) is available; or (b) if the person who is present is a person described in paragraph 5, 6, 7 or 8 of subsection (1), he or she has reason to believe that a person described in an earlier paragraph of subsection (1), other than paragraph 1, 2 or 3, is available and would want to make the decision to give or refuse consent.

Form of statement (12) A statement under subsection (11) may be made in the prescribed form. Meaning of “available” (13) For the purpose of this section, a person is available if it is possible for the health practitioner, within a time that is reasonable in the circumstances, to communicate with the person and obtain a consent or refusal. 1992, c.31, s.17.

Application to appoint representative, treatment delayed 21.

Transition, representative 22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility.

Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23.

Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3).

Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be.

The incapable person’s guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992, if the guardian has authority to consent to the treatment, or his or her attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. 2. The incapable person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers authority to consent to the treatment but has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. 3. The incapable person’s representative appointed by the Board under section 29 to give or refuse consent to the treatment or to treatment of the kind that is proposed. 4. The incapable person’s spouse or partner. 5. The incapable person’s child. 6. The incapable person’s parent, or, if the incapable person is less than sixteen years of age, a person who is lawfully entitled to give or refuse consent to treatment on his or her behalf. 7.

Qualifications (2) Subject to subsection (3), only a person who is at least sixteen years of age and is capable with respect to the treatment may give or refuse consent on the incapable person’s behalf.

Exception re unvalidated power of attorney (4) A person described in paragraph 2 of subsection (1) may not give or refuse consent to the treatment on the incapable person’s behalf if the power of attorney was executed in a hospital or psychiatric facility after the incapable person was found incapable with respect to the treatment. Ranking (5) If two or more persons who are referred to in different paragraphs of subsection (1) claim the authority to give or refuse consent, the claim of the one described in the earlier paragraph prevails. Same (6) Subject to subsection (7), if a person described in one of the paragraphs of subsection (1) is available, a person described in a later paragraph may give or refuse consent only if the one described in the earlier paragraph is not willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent or is himself or herself incapable with respect to the treatment. Family member present when treatment proposed (7) If a person described in paragraph 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of subsection (1) is present when the health practitioner proposes the treatment and no person described in an earlier paragraph is present, the person who is present may give or refuse consent on the incapable person’s behalf unless, (a) the person who is present has reason to believe that a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection (1) is available; or (b) if the person who is present is a person described in paragraph 5, 6, 7 or 8 of subsection (1), he or she has reason to believe that a person described in an earlier paragraph of subsection (1), other than paragraph 1, 2 or 3, is available and would want to make the decision to give or refuse consent.

Duty of P.G.T. (10) In the circumstances described in subsections (8) and (9), the Public Guardian and Trustee is required to make the decision to give or refuse consent. Statement by family member (11) A person described in paragraph 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of subsection (1) shall not give or refuse consent on the incapable person’s behalf without first making a statement that, (a) identifies his or her relationship to the incapable person; (b) indicates that he or she has no reason to believe that the incapable person, before becoming incapable, would have objected to him or her making the decision to give or refuse consent; (c) indicates that he or she has no reason to believe that another person referred to in the same paragraph or an earlier paragraph of subsection (1) claims authority to give or refuse consent; (d) if the person claims authority to give or refuse consent under subsection (7), indicates that he or she has no reason to believe that a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection (1) is available; and (e) if the person claims authority to give or refuse consent under subsection (7) and is a person described in paragraph 5, 6, 7 or 8 of subsection (1), indicates that he or she has no reason to believe that a person described in an earlier paragraph of subsection (1), other than paragraph 1, 2 or 3, is available and would want to make the decision to give or refuse consent. Form of statement (12) A statement under subsection (11) may be made in the prescribed form. Meaning of “available” (13) For the purpose of this section, a person is available if it is possible for the health practitioner, within a time that is reasonable in the circumstances, to communicate with the person and obtain a consent or refusal. 1992, c.31, s.17. Information 18. A person who assumes responsibility for giving or refusing consent on the incapable person’s behalf is entitled to receive all the information required for an informed consent as described in subsection 5(2). 1992, c.31, s.18.

(1) A person who consents to a treatment on an incapable person’s behalf may consent to the incapable person’s admission to a hospital, psychiatric facility or prescribed health facility for the purpose of the treatment, subject to subsection (2). Objection, psychiatric facility (2) If the incapable person is sixteen years of age or more and objects to being admitted to a psychiatric facility for treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act, consent to his or her admission may be given only by, (a) a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992; or (b) an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. 1992, c.31, s.19. Ancillary treatment 20.

Application to appoint representative, treatment delayed 21. If the incapable person indicates that he or she wishes to apply to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to a treatment on his or her behalf, the health practitioner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the incapable person indicated the wish without an application being made; or (b) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of. 1992, c.31, s.21. Transition, representative 22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. Revocation (3) The person may revoke the appointment in writing, if he or she is capable with respect to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. 1992, c.31, s.22. Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be. Reliance on statement (4) A health practitioner is entitled to rely on the accuracy of a statement made under subsection 17(11) (statement by family member), unless it is not reasonable to do so. 1992, c.31, s.26. Person making decision on another’s behalf 27.

            "content": "18. A person who assumes responsibility for giving or refusing consent on the incapable person’s behalf is entitled to receive all the information required for an informed consent as described in subsection 5(2). 1992, c.31, s.18. Admission to hospital, etc. 19. (1) A person who consents to a treatment on an incapable person’s behalf may consent to the incapable person’s admission to a hospital, psychiatric facility or prescribed health facility for the purpose of the treatment, subject to subsection (2). Objection, psychiatric facility (2) If the incapable person is sixteen years of age or more and objects to being admitted to a psychiatric facility for treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act, consent to his or her admission may be given only by, (a) a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992; or (b) an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. 1992, c.31, s.19. Ancillary treatment 20. Authority to consent to a treatment on an incapable person’s behalf includes authority to consent to a treatment that is necessary and ancillary to the treatment, even if the incapable person is capable with respect to the necessary and ancillary treatment. 1992, c.31, s.20. Application to appoint representative, treatment delayed 21. If the incapable person indicates that he or she wishes to apply to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to a treatment on his or her behalf, the health practitioner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the incapable person indicated the wish without an application being made; or (b) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of. 1992, c.31, s.21. Transition, representative 22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. Revocation (3) The person may revoke the appointment in writing, if he or she is capable with respect to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. 1992, c.31, s.22. Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be. Reliance on statement (4) A health practitioner is entitled to rely on the accuracy of a statement made under subsection 17(11) (statement by family member), unless it is not reasonable to do so. 1992, c.31, s.26. Person making decision on another’s behalf 27. A person who gives or refuses consent to treatment on another person’s behalf, acting in good faith and in accordance with this Act, is not liable for giving or refusing consent. 1992, c.31, s.27.

The person. 2. The health practitioner. 3. Any other person whom the Board specifies.

Same (5) The Board may consent to the new application if it is satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances that justifies reconsideration of the person’s capacity. Exception (6) This section does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. 1992, c.31, s.28.

Application for directions 30.

Application with respect to place of treatment 32.

            "content": "19. (1) A person who consents to a treatment on an incapable person’s behalf may consent to the incapable person’s admission to a hospital, psychiatric facility or prescribed health facility for the purpose of the treatment, subject to subsection (2). Objection, psychiatric facility (2) If the incapable person is sixteen years of age or more and objects to being admitted to a psychiatric facility for treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act, consent to his or her admission may be given only by, (a) a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992; or (b) an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. 1992, c.31, s.19. Ancillary treatment 20. Authority to consent to a treatment on an incapable person’s behalf includes authority to consent to a treatment that is necessary and ancillary to the treatment, even if the incapable person is capable with respect to the necessary and ancillary treatment. 1992, c.31, s.20. Application to appoint representative, treatment delayed 21. If the incapable person indicates that he or she wishes to apply to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to a treatment on his or her behalf, the health practitioner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the incapable person indicated the wish without an application being made; or (b) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of. 1992, c.31, s.21. Transition, representative 22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. Revocation (3) The person may revoke the appointment in writing, if he or she is capable with respect to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. 1992, c.31, s.22. Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be. Reliance on statement (4) A health practitioner is entitled to rely on the accuracy of a statement made under subsection 17(11) (statement by family member), unless it is not reasonable to do so. 1992, c.31, s.26. Person making decision on another’s behalf 27. A person who gives or refuses consent to treatment on another person’s behalf, acting in good faith and in accordance with this Act, is not liable for giving or refusing consent. 1992, c.31, s.27.

Same (5) The Board may consent to the new application if it is satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances that justifies reconsideration of the person’s capacity. Exception (6) This section does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. 1992, c.31, s.28.

Application for directions 30.

Application with respect to place of treatment 32.

Authority to consent to a treatment on an incapable person’s behalf includes authority to consent to a treatment that is necessary and ancillary to the treatment, even if the incapable person is capable with respect to the necessary and ancillary treatment. 1992, c.31, s.20. Application to appoint representative, treatment delayed 21. If the incapable person indicates that he or she wishes to apply to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to a treatment on his or her behalf, the health practitioner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the incapable person indicated the wish without an application being made; or (b) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of. 1992, c.31, s.21. Transition, representative 22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. Revocation (3) The person may revoke the appointment in writing, if he or she is capable with respect to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. 1992, c.31, s.22. Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be.

            "content": "21. If the incapable person indicates that he or she wishes to apply to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to a treatment on his or her behalf, the health practitioner shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the treatment is not administered until, (a) forty-eight hours have elapsed since the incapable person indicated the wish without an application being made; or (b) the Board gives a decision in the matter and, (i) the appeal period elapses without an appeal being commenced, or (ii) an appeal of the Board’s decision is finally disposed of. 1992, c.31, s.21. Transition, representative 22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. Revocation (3) The person may revoke the appointment in writing, if he or she is capable with respect to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. 1992, c.31, s.22. Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be. Reliance on statement (4) A health practitioner is entitled to rely on the accuracy of a statement made under subsection 17(11) (statement by family member), unless it is not reasonable to do so. 1992, c.31, s.26. Person making decision on another’s behalf 27. A person who gives or refuses consent to treatment on another person’s behalf, acting in good faith and in accordance with this Act, is not liable for giving or refusing consent. 1992, c.31, s.27.

            "section": null,
            "content": "22. (1) Despite the repeal of section 3 of the Mental Health Act by subsection 20(7) of the Consent and Capacity Statute Law Amendment Act, 1992, this Act applies in respect of a representative whom a person appointed in accordance with section 3 of the Mental Health Act before the day this Act comes into force, as if the representative were the person’s attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that has not been validated under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992. Limited authority (2) The authority conferred by subsection (1) to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf is limited to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. Revocation (3) The person may revoke the appointment in writing, if he or she is capable with respect to treatment administered in a psychiatric facility. 1992, c.31, s.22. Emergency Treatment of Incapable Persons Emergency treatment without consent 23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be. Reliance on statement (4) A health practitioner is entitled to rely on the accuracy of a statement made under subsection 17(11) (statement by family member), unless it is not reasonable to do so. 1992, c.31, s.26. Person making decision on another’s behalf 27. A person who gives or refuses consent to treatment on another person’s behalf, acting in good faith and in accordance with this Act, is not liable for giving or refusing consent. 1992, c.31, s.27.

The person. 2. The health practitioner. 3. Any other person whom the Board specifies. Power of Board (3) The Board may confirm the health practitioner’s finding or may determine that the person is capable with respect to the treatment, and in doing so may substitute its opinion for that of the health practitioner. Restriction on repeated applications (4) A person shall not make a new application within six months after the final disposition of an earlier application for review of a finding of incapacity with respect to the same or similar treatment unless the Board gives leave, in advance. Same (5) The Board may consent to the new application if it is satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances that justifies reconsideration of the person’s capacity. Exception (6) This section does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. 1992, c.31, s.28.

Exception (7) This section does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney given under that Act that confers that authority. 1992, c.31, s.29. Application for directions 30. (1) A person who has assumed the responsibility for giving or refusing consent on behalf of a person who is incapable with respect to a treatment may apply to the Board for directions if the incapable person expressed a wish with respect to the treatment, but, (a) the wish is not clear; (b) it is not clear whether the wish is applicable to the circumstances; (c) it is not clear whether the wish was expressed while the incapable person was capable; or (d) it is not clear whether the wish was expressed after the incapable person attained sixteen years of age.

Any other person whom the Board specifies. Permission, criteria (3) The Board may give the applicant permission to consent to the treatment, despite a wish with respect to the treatment that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, if it is satisfied that the incapable person would probably, if capable, give consent because the likely result of the treatment is significantly better than would have been anticipated in comparable circumstances at the time the wish was expressed. 1992, c.31, s.31. Application with respect to place of treatment 32. (1) A person may apply to the Board for a review of a decision to consent on the person’s behalf to the person’s admission to a hospital, psychiatric facility or health facility referred to in section 19 for the purpose of treatment.

Refusal to meet (3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the incapable person refuses to meet with the rights adviser.

            "content": "23. (1) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner may administer treatment to a person without consent if, in his or her opinion, (a) the person is incapable with respect to the treatment; (b) the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (c) it is not reasonably possible to obtain a consent or refusal on the person’s behalf, or the delay required to do so will prolong the suffering that the person is experiencing or will put the person at risk of suffering serious bodily harm. Same, pending application (2) When an application to the Board to review a finding of incapacity is intended or is pending, the health practitioner may administer the treatment to the person if, (a) consent is given by a person who will be entitled to give or refuse consent on the person’s behalf if the finding of incapacity is confirmed; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm. Same (3) Despite section 21, when an application to the Board to appoint a representative to give or refuse consent to treatment is intended or is pending, subsection (2) applies, with necessary modifications. Examination (4) Despite sections 4 and 21, a health practitioner who is of the opinion that a person is incapable with respect to a treatment may conduct an examination of the person, including diagnostic procedures, without consent, if the examination and diagnostic procedures are reasonably necessary for the purpose of determining whether subsection (1), (2) or (3) applies to the treatment. Record (5) After administering treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the health practitioner shall promptly note in the person’s record a statement setting out the opinion of the health practitioner that is required by subsection (1), (2) or (3). Continuing treatment (6) Treatment under subsection (1) may be continued for as long as is reasonably necessary to find a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Search for authorized person (7) When treatment is administered under subsection (1), the health practitioner shall ensure that efforts are made and are continued for the purpose of finding a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent under section 17 and who is willing to assume the responsibility for giving or refusing consent. Return of capacity (8) If the person becomes capable, in the health practitioner’s opinion, with respect to treatment whose administration has begun under subsection (1), (2) or (3), the person’s own decision to give or refuse consent to the continuation of treatment governs. Person with guardian or attorney (9) Subsection (8) does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. Admission to hospital, etc. (10) The authority to administer treatment under subsection (1), (2) or (3) includes authority to have the person admitted to a hospital or psychiatric facility for the purpose of the treatment, unless the person objects and the treatment is treatment of a mental disorder as defined in the Mental Health Act. Application of s. 9 (11) Section 9 does not apply to a treatment authorized by this section. 1992, c.31, s.23. No treatment contrary to wishes 24. A health practitioner shall not administer a treatment under section 23 if, (a) the health practitioner is informed by a person described in paragaraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1) that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment; or (b) the health practitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the incapable person, while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, expressed a wish applicable to the circumstances to refuse consent to the treatment. 1992, c.31, s.24. Treatment despite refusal 25. If consent to a treatment is refused on behalf of an incapable person by a person who is authorized to give or refuse consent, other than a person described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 17(1), the health practitioner may administer the treatment despite the refusal if, (a) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the incapable person is experiencing severe suffering or is at risk, if the treatment is not administered promptly, of suffering serious bodily harm; and (b) the health practitioner is of the opinion that the person who refused consent did not comply with section 13. 1992, c.31, s.25. Protection from Liability Apparently valid consent 26. (1) If treatment is administered to a person with a consent that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for administering the treatment without consent. Apparently valid refusal (2) If treatment is not administered to a person because of a refusal that a health practitioner believes, on reasonable grounds and in good faith, to be sufficient for the purposes of this Act, the health practitioner is not liable for failure to administer the treatment. Emergency treatment (3) A health practitioner who, in good faith, administers treatment to a person in accordance with section 23 or 25 or refrains from doing so in accordance with section 24 is not liable for administering the treatment without consent or for failure to administer the treatment, as the case may be. Reliance on statement (4) A health practitioner is entitled to rely on the accuracy of a statement made under subsection 17(11) (statement by family member), unless it is not reasonable to do so. 1992, c.31, s.26. Person making decision on another’s behalf 27. A person who gives or refuses consent to treatment on another person’s behalf, acting in good faith and in accordance with this Act, is not liable for giving or refusing consent. 1992, c.31, s.27.

The person. 2. The health practitioner. 3. Any other person whom the Board specifies.

Same (5) The Board may consent to the new application if it is satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances that justifies reconsideration of the person’s capacity. Exception (6) This section does not apply if the person has a guardian of the person appointed under the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992 who has authority to consent to the treatment, or an attorney for personal care under a power of attorney that confers that authority and has been validated under that Act. 1992, c.31, s.28.

Application for directions 30. (1) A person who has assumed the responsibility for giving or refusing consent on behalf of a person who is incapable with respect to a treatment may apply to the Board for directions if the incapable person expressed a wish with respect to the treatment, but, (a) the wish is not clear; (b) it is not clear whether the wish is applicable to the circumstances; (c) it is not clear whether the wish was expressed while the incapable person was capable; or (d) it is not clear whether the wish was expressed after the incapable person attained sixteen years of age.

Any other person whom the Board specifies. Permission, criteria (3) The Board may give the applicant permission to consent to the treatment, despite a wish with respect to the treatment that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, if it is satisfied that the incapable person would probably, if capable, give consent because the likely result of the treatment is significantly better than would have been anticipated in comparable circumstances at the time the wish was expressed. 1992, c.31, s.31. Application with respect to place of treatment 32. (1) A person may apply to the Board for a review of a decision to consent on the person’s behalf to the person’s admission to a hospital, psychiatric facility or health facility referred to in section 19 for the purpose of treatment.
