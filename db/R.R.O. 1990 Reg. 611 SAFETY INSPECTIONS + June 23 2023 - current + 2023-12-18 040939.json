(6) When moderate force is applied to a brake control, the travel shall not exceed 80 per cent of its available travel. (7) With the service brakes properly adjusted, the service brake system shall be tested by stopping the motorcycle on a substantially level, dry, smooth, paved surface free from loose material and, from a rate of speed of not less than 30 kilometres per hour, with heavy pedal or, where applicable, heavy pedal and lever control force, (a) the motorcycle shall come to a complete stop within seven metres; (b) no component shall fail; and (c) each wheel brake shall release immediately after the control force is removed. (7.1) Every motor tricycle shall have a parking brake.
