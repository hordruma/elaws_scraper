O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (3) The capacity of retarders shall not be considered in determining the capacity of the brake systems described in clauses (2) (a), (b) and (c).  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (4) Any combination of the system function requirements described in clauses (2) (a), (b) and (c) may be performed by a single brake system.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (5) Each brake system shall be capable of being, (a)  tested independently; and (b)  readily applied by a worker seated in the driver’s seat.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (6) A service brake system may consist of a hydraulic pump motor drive system.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (7) The service brake system and the emergency brake system shall be capable of safely stopping the motor vehicle while it is being operated, (a)  on the maximum grade, slope or ramp in its area of operation; (b)  at its maximum authorized speed; and (c)  with its maximum authorized load.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (8) The parking brake system shall be capable of holding the motor vehicle stationary, with its maximum authorized load, on the maximum grade, slope or ramp in its area of operation.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (9) The emergency brake system shall be set up so that, whether the brake is applied automatically or manually, a deliberate act is required to release it.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (10) Before a motor vehicle is first put into service, the following systems shall be tested by a competent person for proper operation: 1.  Service brake. 2.  Emergency brake. 3.  Parking brake. 4.  Steering. 5.  Warning devices. 6.  Lighting.  O. Reg. 84/07, s. 6. (11) A record of the tests described in subsection (10), (a)  shall be signed by the competent person who performed the tests; (b)  shall be kept as long as the motor vehicle is in service; and (c)  shall be made available to the joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, if any.
