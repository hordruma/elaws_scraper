(3.3) If more than one producer is liable under subsection (3.1), (3.2) or (3.2.1) in respect of the same truckload, each producer is liable in the same proportion that the producerâs milk has to the volume of the damaged milk. O. Reg. 634/00, s. 4 (1); O. Reg. 901/21, s. 14 (4, 5). (3.4) Subsections (3.2), (3.2.1) and (3.3) do not apply to the extent that the marketing board agrees to accept responsibility for the value of the damaged milk and the costs of disposing of the milk identified in those subsections. O. Reg. 901/21, s. 14 (6). (4) The producer of milk that is tested for its freezing point under section 52 is liable to a penalty in an amount determined under subsection (4.1) if, (a)  the tested milk is found to have an abnormal freezing point; and (b)  where the producerâs milk was sampled previously and found to have an abnormal freezing point, at least 18 days elapsed between the previous sampling and the sampling that led to the finding referred to in clause (a). O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (4). (4.1) The amount of a penalty imposed under subsection (4) is as follows with respect to any milk marketed by the producer in the month in which the milk sample that gave rise to the penalty was taken: 1.  $3 for each hectolitre of milk marketed, in the case of a first or second penalty incurred within a 12-month period. 2.  $4 for each hectolitre of milk marketed, in the case of a third penalty incurred within a 12-month period. 3.  $5 for each hectolitre of milk marketed, in the case of a fourth or subsequent penalty incurred within a 12-month period. O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (4). (4.2) Despite paragraph 1 of subsection (4.1), the Director shall waive the payment of a first penalty incurred within a 12-month period in respect of a finding of an abnormal freezing point and shall notify the producer of the finding. O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (4). (4.3) Despite subsections (4) and (4.1), where an abnormal freezing point in a producerâs milk is found in testing carried out under section 52 for the first time after May 1, 2018, (a)  the Director shall waive the payment of the penalty by the producer and shall notify the producer of the finding; and (b)  any further findings of abnormal freezing points shall be subject to a penalty and the amount of the penalty shall be determined under subsection (4.1) taking into account all previous penalties incurred in the previous 12-month period, including the penalty waived under clause (a). O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (4). (5) Where a fieldperson finds that the milk of a producer is produced from animals or on premises that do not comply with sections 3 to 34.1 or with equipment that does not comply with those sections, or that the producer has not complied with sections 34.2 to 34.5, the producer is, in respect of the milk marketed during the month the finding of non-compliance is made, liable to a penalty of, (a)  $2 for each hectolitre of milk marketed, in the case of a first penalty incurred within a 12-month period; (b)  $4 for each hectolitre of milk marketed, in the case of a second penalty incurred within a 12-month period; and (c)  $8 for each hectolitre of milk marketed, in the case of a third or subsequent penalty incurred within a 12-month period. O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (4). (6) Any penalty to which a producer is liable in any month under subsections (1) to (5) is in addition to any penalty that may be levied under any other of the said subsections. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 761, s. 55 (6). (7) If a producer incurs four penalties or more under subsection (1), (2), (4) or (5) within a 12-month period, including any penalty the payment of which was waived under subsection (4.2) or (4.3), or incurs two penalties or more under subsection (3) within a 12-month period, (a)  the Director shall notify the marketing board and the producer of that fact in writing; and (b)  the milk of the producer shall not be marketed until the producer satisfies the Director that the milk is being produced in compliance with sections 3 to 34.5 and that the milk satisfies the tests described in section 52. O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (5). (7.1) Revoked: O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (5). (8) A notice given to a producer under subsection (7) shall, (a)  notify the producer that the milk shall not be marketed for the reasons set out in the notice; and (b)  give particulars respecting the duration of the rejection. O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (5). (9) If the milk of a producer is rejected under subsection (7), the producer is also liable to pay the amount that the producer is otherwise liable to pay under subsection (1), (2), (3), (3.1), (4) or (5). O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (5); O. Reg. 901/21, s. 14 (7). (10)-(12) Revoked: O. Reg. 122/18, s. 13 (5).",
