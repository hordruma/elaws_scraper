            "content": "41 (1) The driverâs licence of a person who is convicted of an offence, (a)  under section 220, 221 or 236 of the Criminal Code (Canada) committed by means of a motor vehicle or a street car within the meaning of this Act or a motorized snow vehicle; (b)  under section 320.13, 320.16 or 320.17 of the Criminal Code (Canada) committed while driving or having the care, charge or control of a motor vehicle or street car within the meaning of this Act or a motorized snow vehicle; (b.1)  Repealed: 2019, c. 8, Sched. 1, s. 7 (2).

O, s. 2; 2006, c. 20, s. 1; 2007, c. 13, s. 6 (1); 2009, c. 5, s. 10; 2015, c. 14, s. 6 (1); 2019, c. 8, Sched. 1, s. 7 (1-3). Note: The periods of suspension provided for in subsection (1), as it read immediately before September 30, 1998, continue to apply with respect to convictions for offences committed before that date.  See:  1997, c. 12, s. 1 (3). Determining subsequent conviction (2) In determining whether a conviction is a subsequent conviction or an additional subsequent conviction, as the case may be, for the purpose of clauses (1) (g) and (h), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 41 (2). Ten-year limitation (3) Clauses (1) (g) and (h) do not apply when the subsequent conviction is more than 10 years after the previous conviction.  1997, c. 12, s. 1 (2). Note: The five-year limitation provided for in subsection (3), as it read immediately before September 30, 1998, continues to apply with respect to convictions for offences committed before that date.  See:  1997, c. 12, s. 1 (4). Exception (3.0.1) Despite subsection (3), when the subsequent conviction is within 10 years after the previous conviction, all previous convictions that were not followed by a 10-year period without a conviction shall be taken into account for the purpose of clauses (1) (g) and (h).  1997, c. 12, s. 1 (2). Transition (3.0.2) Despite subsections (3) and (3.0.1), a conviction that was more than five years before the date on which this subsection comes into force shall not be taken into account for the purpose of clauses (1) (g) and (h).  1997, c. 12, s. 1 (2). Suspension concurrent with s. 48.3 suspension (3.1) The licence suspension under this section runs concurrently with the remaining portion, if any, of a suspension under section 48.3.  1996, c. 20, s. 5. Order extending suspension (4) Where the court or judge, as the case may be, making the conviction referred to in subsection (1) considers it to be desirable for the protection of the public using the highways, the court or judge may make an order extending the suspension of the licence, (a)  for any period in addition to the period specified in subsection (1) that the court or judge considers proper, if the person is liable to imprisonment for life in respect of the offence; or (b)  for any period in addition to the period specified in subsection (1) that the court or judge considers proper but not exceeding three years, if the person is not liable to imprisonment for life in respect of the offence.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 41 (4). Suspension continued until conduct review program completed (4.1) The suspension of a personâs driverâs licence under clause (1) (f) or (g) continues beyond the one-year or three-year period of suspension imposed under those clauses until the person has successfully completed any conduct review program under section 57 that he or she has been required to participate in. 2015, c. 14, s. 6 (2). Same, transition (4.2) Despite the repeal of section 41.1 under section 7 of the Transportation Statute Law Amendment Act (Making Ontarioâs Roads Safer), 2015, the suspension of a driverâs licence that was imposed under subsection 41.1 (3) before its repeal and that was in effect on the day of its repeal is deemed to continue until the holder of the driverâs licence successfully completes any remedial program that he or she was required to participate in under section 41.1 or any conduct review program that he or she was required to participate in under section 57, as the case may be. 2015, c. 14, s. 6 (2). Transition, ignition interlock condition (4.3) Despite the repeal of section 41.2 under section 7 of the Transportation Statute Law Amendment Act (Making Ontarioâs Roads Safer), 2015, a condition that was imposed on a driverâs licence under subsection 41.2 (1), (5) or (9) before its repeal and that was in effect on the day of its repeal is deemed to continue until the condition is removed or replaced under a conduct review program under section 57. 2015, c. 14, s. 6 (2). Order for discharge (5) This section applies in the same manner as if a person were convicted of an offence if the person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence referred to in subsection (1) and, (a)  an order directing that the accused be discharged is made under section 730 of the Criminal Code (Canada) or under a provision that is enacted by a state of the United States of America and that is designated by the regulations; or (b)  a disposition is made under section 20 or sections 28 to 32 of the Young Offenders Act (Canada) or a youth sentence is imposed under section 42, 59, 94, 95 or 96 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (Canada) or an adult sentence is imposed under the Youth Criminal Justice Act\r\n(Canada), including a confirmation or variation of the disposition or sentence.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 41 (5); 2000, c. 26, Sched. O, s. 1; 2006, c. 19, Sched. D, s. 9 (2). Appeal (6) An appeal may be taken from an order for additional suspension made under subsection (4) and the provisions of the Criminal Code (Canada) applying to an appeal from the conviction referred to in subsection (1) apply in respect of an appeal from an order made under subsection (4).  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 41 (6). Stay of order on appeal (7) Where an appeal is taken under subsection (6), the court being appealed to may direct that the order being appealed from shall be stayed pending the final disposition of the appeal or until otherwise ordered by that court.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 41 (7). No cause of action (8) No person whose licence is or was suspended under subsection (1) or a predecessor thereof has a cause of action against the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or Her Majesty the Queen in right of Ontario for any misapplication of, or misadvice about, the suspension period under subsection (1) or predecessor thereof.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 41 (8). Interpretation (9) Where a conviction is made under the Criminal Code (Canada) in relation to an offence set out in subsection (1) or section 42, and that conviction is reported to the Ministry without a section number or as having taken place under section 320.19, 320.2, 320.21 or 320.24 of the Criminal Code (Canada), the conviction shall be treated as if it were made and reported under the applicable provision of the Criminal Code (Canada) set out in subsection (1) or section 42. 2019, c. 8, Sched. 1, s. 7 (4).

Screening device, instrument used for second analysis (6.1) The second analysis must be performed with a different approved screening device than was used in the analysis under subsection (2) or, if the police officer thinks it is preferable, with an instrument approved as suitable for the purpose of section 320.27 or 320.28 of the Criminal Code (Canada).  2009, c. 5, s. 15 (8); 2019, c. 8, Sched. 1, s. 1. Second analysis governs (6.2) Where a person provides a sample of breath for the second analysis requested under subsection (6) immediately upon being requested to do so by the police officer, the result of the second analysis governs and any suspension resulting from the analysis under subsection (2) continues or terminates accordingly.  2009, c. 5, s. 15 (8). Calibration of screening device (7) For the purposes of subsection (2), the approved screening device shall not be calibrated to register âWarnâ or âAlertâ or to otherwise indicate that the concentration of alcohol in the personâs blood is 50 milligrams or more of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood if the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the person whose breath is being analyzed is less than 50 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Same (8) It shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that any approved screening device used for the purposes of subsection (2) has been calibrated as required under subsection (7).  2007, c. 13, s. 10. No appeal or hearing (9) There is no appeal from, or right to be heard before, the suspension of a driverâs licence under this section.  2007, c. 13, s. 10; 2009, c. 5, s. 15 (9); 2019, c. 8, Sched. 1, s. 2. Intent of suspension (10) The suspension of a licence under this section is intended to safeguard the licensee and the public and does not constitute an alternative to any proceeding or penalty arising from the same circumstances or around the same time.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Duties of officer (11) Every police officer who asks for the surrender of a licence under this section shall, (a)  notify the Registrar of that fact, or cause the Registrar to be so notified, in the form and manner and within the time required by the Registrar; (b)  keep a record of the licence received with the name and address of the person and the date and time of the suspension; (c)  provide the licensee with a written statement of the time from which the suspension takes effect, the period of time for which the licence is suspended and the place where the licence may be recovered; and (d)  forward to the Registrar such other material or information as may be prescribed by the regulations. 2015, c. 14, s. 9 (2). Removal of vehicle (12) If the motor vehicle of a person whose licence is suspended under this section is at a location from which, in the opinion of a police officer, it should be removed and there is no person available who may lawfully remove the vehicle, the officer may remove and store the vehicle or cause it to be removed and stored, in which case the officer shall notify the person of the location of the storage.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Cost of removal (13) Where a police officer obtains assistance for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under this section, the costs incurred in moving and storing the vehicle are a lien on the vehicle that may be enforced under the Repair and Storage Liens Act by the person who moved or stored the vehicle at the request of the officer.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Period of suspension (14) A driverâs licence suspended under subsection (4) shall be suspended for, (a)  three days, in the case of a first suspension under this section; (b)  seven days, in the case of a second suspension under this section; (c)  30 days, in the case of a third or subsequent suspension under this section.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Same (15) The following previous suspensions shall not be taken into account in determining whether the current suspension is a first, second or subsequent suspension for the purpose of subsection (14): 1.  A previous suspension that took effect more than five years before the current suspension takes effect. 2.  A previous suspension that took effect before section 10 of the Safer Roads for a Safer Ontario Act, 2007\r\ncomes into force.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Police officerâs other powers unchanged (16) Subsection (1) shall not be construed so as to prevent a police officer from requiring a driver stopped under that subsection to surrender any licence, permit, card or other document that the officer is otherwise authorized to demand under this Act or the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act or from requiring a driver to submit a vehicle to examinations and tests under subsection 82 (2) of this Act.  2007, c. 13, s. 10. Regulations (17) The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations prescribing other material or information to be forwarded to the Registrar under clause (11) (d). 2015, c. 14, s. 9 (3).

Meaning of suspension for out-of-province licences (19) With respect to a driverâs licence issued by another jurisdiction, instead of the personâs driverâs licence being suspended, the personâs privilege to drive a motor vehicle in Ontario is suspended for the applicable period determined under subsection (14), and this section and section 53 apply to the suspension of that privilege with necessary modifications. 2015, c. 14, s. 9 (5).
