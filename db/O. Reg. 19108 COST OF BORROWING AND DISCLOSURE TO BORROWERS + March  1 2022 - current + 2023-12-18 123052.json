O. Reg. 191/08, s. 3 (1). (2) For the purpose of subsection (1), (a)  the APR may be rounded off to the nearest eighth of a per cent; (b)  each instalment payment made on the mortgage must be applied first to the accumulated cost of borrowing and then to the outstanding principal; (c)  a period of, (i)  one month is 1/12 of a year, (ii)  one week is 1/52 of a year, and (iii)  one day is 1/365 of a year; (d)  if the annual interest rate underlying the calculation is variable over the period of the mortgage, it must be set as the annual interest rate that applies on the day that the calculation is made; (e)  if there are no instalment payments under the mortgage, then the APR must be calculated on the basis that the outstanding principal is to be repaid in one lump sum at the end of the term of the mortgage; and (f)  a mortgage for an amount that comprises, in whole or in part, an outstanding balance from a prior mortgage is a new mortgage for the purpose of the calculation.
