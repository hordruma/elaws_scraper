(1.2) Subject to subcondition (1.7), if the insurer gives a notice of termination under subcondition (1) for the reason of non-payment of the whole or any part of the premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract, the notice of termination shall comply with subcondition (1.3) and shall specify a day for the termination of the contract that is no earlier than, (a) the 30th day after the insurer gives the notice, if the insurer gives the notice by registered mail; or (b) the 10th day after the insurer gives the notice, if the insurer gives the notice by personal delivery, prepaid courier or electronic means. (1.3) A notice of termination mentioned in subcondition (1.2) shall, (a) state the amount due under the contract as at the date of the notice; and (b) state that the contract will terminate at 12:01 a.m. of the day specified for termination unless the full amount mentioned in clause (a), together with an administration fee not exceeding the amount approved under Part XV of the Act, payable in cash or by money order or certified cheque payable to the order of the insurer or as the notice otherwise directs, is delivered to the address in Ontario that the notice specifies, not later than 12:00 noon on the business day before the day specified for termination.

(1.5) If the full amount payable under clause (b) of subcondition (1.3) is not paid by the time and in the manner that the notice specifies, the contract shall be deemed to be terminated, without any further action being required on the part of the insurer, as of 12:01 a.m. of the day specified for termination.

(2) This contract may be terminated by the insured at any time on request. (3) Where this contract is terminated by the insurer, (a) the insurer shall refund the excess of premium actually paid by the insured over the proportionate premium for the expired time, but in no event shall the proportionate premium for the expired time be deemed to be less than any minimum retained premium specified; (b) if the termination is for a reason other than non-payment of the whole or any part of the premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract or if the insurer gives a notice of termination in accordance with subcondition (1.7), the refund shall accompany the notice, unless the premium is subject to adjustment or determination as to the amount, in which case, the refund shall be made as soon as practicable; and (c) if the termination is for the reason of non-payment of the whole or any part of the premium due under the contract or of any charge under any agreement ancillary to the contract and if subcondition (1.7) does not apply to the termination, the refund shall be made as soon as practicable after the effective date of the termination.

(5) For the purpose of clause (a) of subconditions (1.1) and (1.2), the day on which the insurer gives the notice by registered mail shall be deemed to be the day after the day of mailing. (5.1) For the purpose of clause (b) of subconditions (1.1) and (1.2), (a) the day on which the insurer gives the notice by prepaid courier shall be deemed to be the day after the day there is a record by the person who delivered it that the notice has been sent; and (b) the day on which the insurer gives the notice by electronic means shall be deemed to be the day after the day the notice is sent.
