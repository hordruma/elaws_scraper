Reduction in contributions of successor employer (3) Despite subsection 104 (1), a successor employer who permits an affiliate to be a participating employer under the plan shall contribute to the pension fund for the plan for a year the amount determined by multiplying the rate described in subsection (4) by the pensionable earnings of the members of the plan who are employees of the successor employer, other than their pensionable earnings, if any, as employees of a participating affiliate.  2000, c. 42, s. 39. Rate for employer contributions (4) The rate for a year is determined by calculating the amount by which the normal cost in respect of all members of the plan exceeds the contributions made for the year to the pension fund for the plan by all members and dividing that amount by the pensionable earnings of all members of the plan for the year, as determined by the actuary of the plan.  2000, c. 42, s. 39. Reduction, etc., in contributions (5) If the plan has a surplus or a prior year credit balance or both, the successor employer, in its sole discretion acting in its capacity as an employer, may permit the participating affiliate to reduce or suspend its contributions to the pension fund to the extent permitted under the Pension Benefits Act, and the affiliate, in its sole discretion acting as employer, may do so.  2000, c. 42, s. 39.
