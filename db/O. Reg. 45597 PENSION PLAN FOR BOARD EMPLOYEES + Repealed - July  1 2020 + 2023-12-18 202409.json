(1) This section applies with respect to a member who, (a)  is suffering from a physical or mental impairment that prevents the member from performing the duties of the employment in which he or she was engaged before the commencement of the impairment; and (b)  is receiving benefits under the long-term disability plan as a result of an impairment incurred on or after October 1, 1974.  O. Reg. 455/97, s. 14 (1). (2) During the period that the member is receiving benefits under the long-term disability plan and remains an employee of the Board, the Board shall make both the Board and the member contributions to the pension plan.  O. Reg. 455/97, s. 14 (2). (3) For the purposes of this Regulation, the member’s earnings shall be deemed to be increased each year in accordance with the following rules: 1.  The earnings are increased as of January 1 each year, beginning when the member begins to receive benefits under the long-term disability plan and ending when payment of the member’s pension under the plan begins. However, no increase shall be made in respect of a period before January 1, 1992. 2.  The earnings are increased in accordance with the indexing factor described in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 for the year. 3.  Despite paragraph 2, the increased earnings for a year cannot exceed the maximum amount determined under paragraph 7. 4.  The indexing factor for a year is 75 per cent of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Canada for all items, for the 12-month period ending October 31 of the previous year, as published by Statistics Canada.  If the change in the Consumer Price Index is negative the indexing factor is zero. 5.  If the indexing factor for a year is greater than 8 per cent, it is deemed to be 8 per cent. 6.  If the indexing factor for a year is greater than 8 per cent, the amount by which it exceeds 8 per cent is carried forward and added to the indexing factor for one or more subsequent years until the subsequent indexing factor is increased to 8 per cent. 7.  The maximum amount of increased earnings for a year is calculated using the formula “A × B/C” in which, “A”  equals the person’s earnings when he or she qualified for benefits under the long-term disability plan, “B”  equals the average wage as defined in subsection 147.1 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) for the year, and “C”  equals the average wage for the year in which the person qualified for benefits under the long-term disability plan.
