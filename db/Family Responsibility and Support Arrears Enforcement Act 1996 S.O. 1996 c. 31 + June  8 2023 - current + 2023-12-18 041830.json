Effect on arrears (3) Payment terms that are included in an order to refrain do not affect the accruing of arrears, nor do they affect any other means of enforcing the support order.  2005, c. 16, s. 18. Exceptions (4) Despite subsection (1), a motion for an order to refrain may be made, (a) before making a motion to change the support order, on the undertaking of the payor or the payor’s lawyer to obtain, within 20 days after the date of the order to refrain, a court date for the motion to change the support order; or (b) without making a motion to change the support order, if the payor has started an appeal of the support order and the appeal has not been determined.  2005, c. 16, s. 18.

Court may change or terminate order to refrain (9) When an undertaking is made under subsection (8), the court may change or terminate the order to refrain, without proof of a material change in circumstances, on motion by the Director, if, (a) the 20-day period has expired and the proof of income has not been served and filed; or (b) the proof of income has been served and filed and the court is satisfied that a different order would have been made if the proof of income had been available when the motion for the order to refrain was heard.  2005, c. 16, s. 18. Time limits and changing order to refrain (10) A court shall not make an order to refrain after the 30-day period referred to in the first notice, but an order to refrain may be changed, on motion by the payor or the Director, at any time before the motion to change support is determined if there is a material change in the payor’s circumstances.  2005, c. 16, s. 18. Same (11) A court may make an order to refrain only within the 30-day period referred to in the first notice and may make only one order to refrain in respect of any first notice.  2005, c. 16, s. 18.

When Director is a party (16) The Director is not a party to a motion to change a support order referred to in subsection (1), but the Director and the payor are the only parties to a motion under subsection (1) for an order to refrain.  2005, c. 16, s. 18. Filing with Director’s office (17) The court shall file a copy of the order in the Director’s office promptly after the order is signed.  2005, c. 16, s. 18.

Exception (20) Despite subsection (19), an order to refrain made before the making of a motion to change the support order is automatically terminated if the payor does not, within 20 days after the date of the order to refrain, obtain a court date for the motion to change the support order.  2005, c. 16, s. 18. Extension of order (21) The court that made an order to refrain may, on a motion made by the payor with notice to the Director, extend the order for one further period of, (a) three months, unless clause (b) applies; or (b) six months, if the motion to change is being dealt with under section 44 of the Family Law Act, section 18.1, 18.2 or 19 of the Divorce Act (Canada) or the\r\nInterjurisdictional Support Orders Act, 2002.  2005, c. 16, s. 18; 2020, c. 25, Sched. 1, s. 29 (2). Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, clause 35 (21) (b) of the Act is amended by striking out “the Divorce Act (Canada) or the Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act, 2002” at the end and substituting “the Divorce Act (Canada), the Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act, 2002 or the International Recovery of Child Support and Family Maintenance Convention Act, 2023”. (See: 2023, c. 9, Sched. 16, s. 25 (6)) Time for extending order (22) An extending order under subsection (21) shall not be made after the order to refrain has terminated.  2005, c. 16, s. 18.

Enforcement of order (16) The Director may enforce an order against a person made under subsection (12), (14) or (15) in the same manner as he or she may enforce an order against the payor.  2005, c. 16, s. 24.
