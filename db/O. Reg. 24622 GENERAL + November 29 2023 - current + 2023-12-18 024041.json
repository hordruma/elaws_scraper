(3) The following modifications are made to the application of section 50 of the Act: 1.  Before the person submits an application for determination of eligibility for admission, the placement co-ordinator shall provide the person with information about the process for admission to a long-term care home as a short-stay resident in the convalescent care program, including, i.  the nature of the referral process for admission under this section, ii.  the factors that the placement co-ordinator will take into consideration when referring the applicant to a bed in the convalescent care program, and iii.  the fact that the person will only be admitted to a home with their consent, in accordance with clause 51 (11) (d) and section 52 of the Act. 2.

The placement co-ordinator shall refer the applicant to one or more homes with a convalescent care program. In determining to which home or homes to refer the applicant, the placement co-ordinator shall take into consideration the following factors: i.  The applicant’s condition and circumstances. ii.  The applicant’s preferences, including any preferences relating to the proximity of the home or homes to the applicant’s family, home and community and support networks. 2.  If a home to which the applicant is being referred is not in the geographic area of the placement co-ordinator making the referral, that placement co-ordinator shall co-ordinate with the appropriate placement co-ordinator for that home. 3.  Instead of the applicant applying for authorization of admission, the appropriate placement co-ordinator shall provide the necessary information to the licensee or licensees of the home or homes to which the applicant is being referred. 4.  In subsections 51 (7) to (10) and (14) of the Act, i.  any reference to a “selected” home shall be read as applying to a home to which the applicant is referred, ii.  the licensee’s written notice of withholding of approval or withdrawal of approval required under subsections 51 (9) and (14) of the Act is only required to be given to the appropriate placement co-ordinator, but the appropriate placement co-ordinator shall provide a copy to the applicant upon request. (5) For the purposes of applying this Regulation under the circumstances where this section applies, (a)  subsections 179 (3) and (4) of this Regulation shall be read as if they said “three business days” rather than “five business days”; (b)  subsection 179 (5) of this Regulation shall be read as if it said “one business day” rather than “three business days”; (c)  clause 183 (1) (b) of this Regulation does not apply; (d)  Column 2 of Item 9 of the Table to section 200 of this Regulation shall be read as if it referred to the time at which the applicant agreed to proceed with an application under section 50 of the Act; (e)  paragraph 2 of subsection 202 (4) of this Regulation shall be read as if it said that the licensee shall give the written notice of the withdrawal of approval for the applicant’s admission only to the appropriate placement co-ordinator, but that the appropriate placement co-ordinator shall provide a copy to the applicant upon request; (f)  clause 203 (1) (a) of this Regulation shall be read as if it only required that the requirements set out in subsection 51 (11) of the Act be complied with. (6) If a person to whom this section applies does not choose to participate in the process under this section, the placement co-ordinator shall, if the person so desires, provide information about alternative services, make appropriate referrals on behalf of the person and assist in arranging alternative accommodation, care or services for the person as is appropriate in the circumstances.

(1) Where a long-stay resident of a long-term care home has accessed all sources of income to maximize their annual net income, the resident may apply to the Director for a reduced amount payable by the resident for basic accommodation during a term determined in accordance with subsection (7). (2) An application, (a)  must be in a form and manner acceptable to the Director; (b)  must include any supporting documentation required by the Director; and (c)  must include the Notice of Assessment issued under the Income Tax Act (Canada) or the proof of income statement (option “C” print) from the Canada Revenue Agency for the resident’s most recent taxation year, unless, (i)  the resident is receiving income support under the Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997, (ii)  the Public Guardian and Trustee is the guardian of property for the resident, or (iii)  the resident has provided written authorization to electronically obtain income information for the resident’s most recent taxation year from the Canada Revenue Agency. (3) Upon the request of a resident, a licensee shall provide assistance in completing the application. (4) The licensee shall, (a)  verify that all parts of the application are provided by the resident; (b)  submit the application in a form and manner acceptable to the Director; (c)  ensure that the information is recorded correctly; (d)  retain a copy of the application; and (e)  notify the resident of the amount payable for basic accommodation as determined by the Director. (5) The licensee shall not submit an application with information that the licensee knows, ought to know or reasonably suspects to be false or incomplete. (6) Where a failure by a licensee to comply with subsection (4) or (5) results in the maximum amount determined under subsection (7) to be incorrect, the licensee shall be solely liable for the difference in amount and shall repay the difference in a manner as determined by the Director. (7) Despite section 291, where a resident has applied for a reduction under this section, the Director shall determine the maximum monthly amount that may be charged by a licensee for providing a resident with basic accommodation during a term as follows, and the licensee shall not charge the resident more than that amount for the basic accommodation: 1.  Divide the resident’s annual net income by 12, and subtract an allowance of the amount set out in paragraph 1 of subsection 32 (1) of Ontario Regulation 222/98 (General) made under the Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997. Subject to paragraphs 2 to 4, the resulting amount is the maximum monthly amount that may be charged. 2.  Where the resident requests a reduction to retain income to support one or more dependants, subtract the amount determined under subsection (9), (11) or (12) from the amount determined under paragraph 1. 3.  Where the calculations under paragraph 1, or where paragraph 2 applies, under paragraphs 1 and 2, would result in a negative number, the amount is deemed to be nil. 4.  Where the calculations under paragraph 1, or where paragraph 2 applies, under paragraphs 1 and 2, would result in a number greater than the maximum monthly amount under subsection 292 (3), the amount is the amount under subsection 292 (3). (8) Despite section 292 and subsection (7), where the resident is receiving income support under the Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997, the annual net income divided by 12 as required by paragraph 1 of subsection (7) is deemed to be an amount equal to the total of the amounts set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection 32 (1) of Ontario Regulation 222/98 (General) made under that Act. (9) The amount to be subtracted for the purposes of paragraph 2 of subsection (7) shall be determined as follows: 1.  For the first dependant to be supported add $1,462.87, subject to subsection (11), unless the dependant is a child living with a parent or other person with lawful custody. 2.  For each dependant to be supported to whom paragraph 1 does not apply, add $630.72, subject to subsection (11). 3.  For each dependant to be supported, subtract the dependant’s annual net income divided by 12 from the sum of the amounts determined by paragraphs 1 and 2. 4.  Where the calculation under paragraph 3 would result in a negative number, the amount is deemed to be nil. (10) The amounts set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection (9) are subject to the annual adjustment described in section 297. (11) Where a resident received a reduction in the amount payable for basic accommodation under section 253 of Ontario Regulation 79/10 (General) made under the former Act, immediately before the coming into force of this section, and is not eligible to have an amount subtracted under subsection (9), the Director may determine the amount for the purposes of paragraph 2 of subsection (7). (12) Where a resident received a reduction in the amount payable for basic accommodation to support a spouse or child, immediately before the coming into force of this section, and that reduction was not based on an application under section 253 of Ontario Regulation 79/10 (General) made under the former Act, the Director may determine the amount for the purposes of paragraph 2 of subsection (7). (13) A resident who has not entered into an agreement mentioned in subsection (14) shall not be charged more than the amount payable for basic accommodation where the resident continues to occupy a bed in a room that was occupied with their spouse, and, (a)  the spouse no longer occupies the room with the resident; (b)  the resident has requested a transfer to basic accommodation in the home; and (c)  the resident has not yet been transferred to basic accommodation in the home in accordance with subsection 239 (7). (14) A resident shall enter into an agreement with the licensee for preferred accommodation, in accordance with paragraph 2 of subsection 94 (1) of the Act, where the resident wishes to continue to occupy a bed in a room that was occupied with their spouse and that room has ceased to be a standard room, and where the resident does not enter into an agreement, the licensee may transfer the resident to a standard room in accordance with subsection 239 (7), as if the resident had requested a transfer to a basic accommodation at the time the room ceased to be a standard room. (15) Any amounts determined under this section for periods of less than a month, shall be determined by the Director proportionately. (16) The Director may retroactively adjust the maximum amount payable that was determined for the same resident in prior terms before determining the maximum monthly amount that the resident may be charged under the current application.
