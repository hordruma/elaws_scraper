If the battery collection site is not part of a retail location, the site must accept all batteries. 2. If the battery collection site is part of a retail location, the site must accept, at a minimum, all batteries that fall into the same category and are similar in size and function to the batteries supplied by the producer at that location. 3.

(4) Subject to subsection (6), a producer may reduce the number of battery collection sites the producer is required to establish and operate in a local municipality or territorial district under subsection 9 (2) or 10 (2), as the case may be, by the percentage of batteries that the producer supplied in Ontario in the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the applicable performance period begins that were subject to a collection program operated by or on behalf of the producer that, (a) allowed the consumer to return the batteries, at no charge, in a manner that was, at a minimum, equivalent to the manner in which the batteries were supplied; and (b) provided the consumer, at no charge, with the packaging or shipping materials required to return the batteries. (5) Subject to subsection (6), a producer may replace a portion of battery collection sites the producer is required to establish and operate in a local municipality or territorial district under subsection 9 (2) or 10 (2), as the case may be, with public battery collection events in accordance with the following rules: 1. A producer may replace up to 25 per cent of the total number of battery collection sites the producer is required to provide in Ontario, regardless of any reductions under subsections (3) and (4), with the same number of public battery collection events. 2.
