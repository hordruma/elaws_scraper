If the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board is less than 4,000, i. multiply the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board by $0.01631, ii. subtract the amount determined under subparagraph i from $300.27, and iii. multiply the amount determined under subparagraph ii by the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board. 2. If the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board is at least 4,000 but less than 8,000, i. subtract 4,000 from the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board, ii. multiply the number determined under subparagraph i by $0.01873, iii. subtract the amount determined under subparagraph ii from $235.04, and iv. multiply the amount determined under subparagraph iii by the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board. 3. If the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board is 8,000 or more, i. subtract 8,000 from the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board, ii. multiply the number determined under subparagraph i by $0.02002, iii. subtract the amount determined under subparagraph ii from $160.14, iv. if the amount determined under subparagraph iii is greater than zero, multiply the amount determined under subparagraph iii by the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board, and v. if the amount determined under subparagraph iii is not greater than zero, the board’s small board amount is zero. O. Reg. 152/07, s. 33 (2); O. Reg. 507/07, s. 10 (1-6). (3) The board’s distance amount is, (a) the product of the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board multiplied by the board’s distance factor per pupil, if the board is an English-language district school board; or (b) the product of the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board multiplied by the greater of the board’s distance factor per pupil or $167.32, if the board is a French-language district school board. O. Reg. 152/07, s. 33 (3); O. Reg. 507/07, s. 10 (7). (4) The board’s distance factor per pupil is the amount determined by multiplying the urban factor specified for the board in Column 3 of Table 6 by the amount determined under the following paragraph that applies to the board: 1. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is less than 151 kilometres, the amount is zero. 2. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 151 kilometres but less than 650 kilometres, the amount is determined using the formula: (A – 150) × $1.02438 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 3. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 650 kilometres but less than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is determined using the formula: [(A – 650) × $0.13786] + $512.19 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 4. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is $581.12. O. Reg. 152/07, s. 33 (4); O. Reg. 507/07, s. 10 (8-10). (5) The board’s dispersion amount is the amount calculated using the formula, (DD – F) × ADE × $5.38996 in which, “DD” is the dispersion distance in kilometres set out in Column 4 of Table 6 opposite the name of the board in Column 1 of that Table, “F” is the lesser of “DD” and 14 kilometres, and “ADE” is the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board.

The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2007 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2007-2008 school year and October 31, 2007, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. 9.

O. Reg. 152/07, s. 36 (11). (12) The amount of the elementary school teacher qualification and experience allocation for a district school board is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 8, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and 0.7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 8, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in that Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils. 5.

For each cell in Table 8, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in that Table. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils. 5. Subtract one from the number obtained under paragraph 4. 6. Multiply the result obtained under paragraph 5 by $4,391. 7. Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board. O. Reg. 152/07, s. 36 (13).",

The product obtained when 0.25 is multiplied by the amount, if any, that was determined under subsection 38 (3) of the 2005-2006 grant regulation. 2. The product obtained when 0.5 is multiplied by the amount, if any, that was determined under subsection 41 (2) of the 2006-2007 grant regulation. 3. If the 2007-2008 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board is less than the 2006-2007 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board as determined under section 2 of Ontario Regulation 339/06 (Calculation of Average Daily Enrolment for the 2006-2007 School Board Fiscal Year) made under the Act, the amount, if it exceeds zero, determined in accordance with subsection (2). O. Reg. 152/07, s. 53 (1).

O. Reg. 152/07, s. 53 (4); O. Reg. 507/07, s. 19 (2, 3).

If the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (5) does not exceed 0.0025, the amount determined under this subsection in respect of the board is calculated using the formula, 0.5 × C in which, “C” is the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (5). 2. If the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (5) is greater than 0.0025 but does not exceed 0.015, the amount determined under this subsection in respect of the board is calculated using the formula, (C – 0.0025) + 0.00125 in which, “C” is the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (5). 3. If the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (5) is greater than 0.015, the amount determined under this subsection in respect of the board is calculated using the formula, 1.5 × (C – 0.015) + 0.01375 in which, “C” is the amount determined in respect of the board under subsection (5).
