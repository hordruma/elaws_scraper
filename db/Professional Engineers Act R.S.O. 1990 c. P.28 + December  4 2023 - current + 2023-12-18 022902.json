A professional engineer or an architect may prepare or provide a design for the construction, enlargement or alteration of a building, i.  that exceeds 600 square metres in gross area or three storeys, and ii.  that is used or intended for, A.  industrial occupancy, or B.  mixed occupancy consisting of industrial occupancy and one or more other occupancies, where none of the other occupancies exceeds 600 square metres of the gross area, but only a professional engineer may provide services within the practice of professional engineering in connection with the design. 3.  Subject to rules 4 and 5, a professional engineer shall provide services that are within the practice of professional engineering and an architect shall provide services that are within the practice of architecture related to the construction, enlargement or alteration of a building used or intended for, i.  assembly occupancy, ii.  institutional occupancy, iii.  business occupancy or personal services occupancy that exceeds 600 square metres in gross area or three storeys, iv.  mercantile occupancy that exceeds 600 square metres in gross area or three storeys, v.  residential occupancy that exceeds three storeys, vi.  mixed occupancy consisting of industrial occupancy and one or more other occupancies, where one of the other occupancies exceeds 600 square metres in gross area, vii.  mixed occupancy consisting of a combination of, A.  assembly occupancy and any other occupancy, except industrial occupancy, B.  institutional occupancy and any other occupancy, except industrial occupancy, C.  one or more of, 1.  business occupancy, 2.  personal services occupancy, or 3.  mercantile occupancy, and any other occupancy, except assembly occupancy, institutional occupancy or industrial occupancy, where the building as constructed, enlarged or altered exceeds 600 square metres in gross area or three storeys, D.  residential occupancy that exceeds three storeys and any other occupancy, where the building as constructed, enlarged or altered exceeds 600 square metres in gross area, or viii.  any other occupancy where the building as constructed, enlarged or altered exceeds 600 square metres in gross area or three storeys, but a professional engineer may provide a design for the industrial occupancy of a mixed occupancy described in subparagraph vi. 4.  An architect may perform or provide services that are within the practice of professional engineering in preparing or providing a design for and carrying out the general review of the construction, enlargement or alteration of a building described in rule 2 or 3 where to do so does not constitute a substantial part of the services within the practice of professional engineering related to the construction, enlargement or alteration of the building and is necessary, i.  for the construction, enlargement or alteration of the building and is incidental to other services provided as part of the practice of architecture by the architect in respect of the construction, enlargement or alteration of the building, or ii.  for co-ordination purposes. 5.
