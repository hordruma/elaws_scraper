(3) Clauses (1) (c) and (h) do not apply to the manufacturer of a drug product if the dosage form, strength, formula and manufacturing process of the product and the testing standards for both the raw materials of the product and the finished product are identical to those of the product with which it seeks to be designated as interchangeable.

(4) A manufacturer may satisfy the condition set out in clause (1) (h) for a strength of a drug product by submitting the evidence referred to in clause (1) (h) for another strength of the same dosage form of the drug product if that information is sufficient for the purposes of evaluating the interchangeability of both the strengths of the dosage form of the product.  O. Reg. 18/96, s. 1. (5) Clause (1) (h) does not apply with respect to a drug product that is pharmaceutically equivalent to the original product, demonstrates the same physicochemical properties of the original product, is the same dosage form, packaging format and strength as the original product and is one of the following: 1. A parenteral aqueous solution, or a powder for reconstitution into an aqueous solution, that may be administered in an intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intrathecal fashion and that is in the same solvent and in the same concentration as the original product. 2. An oral solution, elixir, syrup or other similar solubilized form in the same concentration as the original product and which contains no ingredient that will affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient. 3. An ophthalmic, otic, nasal, rectal, vaginal or inhaled solution that is topical and aqueous.  O. Reg. 18/96, s. 1; O. Reg. 496/00, s. 1 (9); O. Reg. 285/15, s. 1 (1). (5.1) Revoked: O. Reg. 319/16, s. 2 (2). (6) Clause (1) (h) does not apply to a drug product that has a non-systemic effect where blood concentrations of the product cannot be measured and clinical studies with a pharmacodynamics endpoint are inappropriate or difficult to conduct if all of the following conditions are met: 1. The manufacturer provides in vitro studies that satisfy the executive officer that the product is interchangeable with the original product. 2. The manufacturer satisfies the executive officer that the in vitro studies described in paragraph 1 are scientifically justified, appropriate for the drug class and can demonstrate equal drug product performance. O. Reg. 319/16, s. 2 (2). (7) Subsection (1) does not apply to a generic line extension drug product that the executive officer has agreed to designate as interchangeable with another product. O. Reg. 319/16, s. 2 (2). (7.1), (7.2) Revoked: O. Reg. 319/16, s. 2 (2). (8) A strength and dosage form of a drug product that contains oxycodone as the only active ingredient and that is a long-acting product that has been formulated in a solid dosage form for oral administration shall not be designated as interchangeable unless the following conditions are met: 1. There must be evidence satisfactory to the executive officer that the drug product exhibits one or more physiochemical properties that, when compared to drugs without the property or properties, make the drug product, i. significantly more difficult to alter, break, crush, chew, dissolve or otherwise manipulate in such a way that it could be misused, abused or put to an intended use that is different than the use for which it is prescribed, or ii. significantly less effective and less likely to be misused, abused or put to an intended use that is different than the use for which it is prescribed, if the product is altered, broken, crushed, chewed, dissolved or otherwise manipulated. 2. The evidence referred to in paragraph 1 must be demonstrated by, i. in vitro testing, ii. in vivo testing, iii. another form of testing of equivalent reliability, or iv. a combination of any of the forms of testing mentioned in subparagraphs i to iii.
