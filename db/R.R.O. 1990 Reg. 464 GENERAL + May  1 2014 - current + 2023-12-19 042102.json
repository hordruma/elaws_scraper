O. Reg. 141/96, s. 5. (12) Where a registered dyer wishes to use a dye injection system or fuel delivery system under subsection (11), it must satisfy the Minister that the dye injection system or fuel delivery system will dye or deliver fuel in accordance with the prescribed specifications and will not allow, (a) the contamination of either coloured fuel or clear fuel with the other fuel; (b) the delivery of clear fuel when coloured fuel is intended to be delivered or the delivery of coloured fuel when clear fuel is intended to be delivered.
