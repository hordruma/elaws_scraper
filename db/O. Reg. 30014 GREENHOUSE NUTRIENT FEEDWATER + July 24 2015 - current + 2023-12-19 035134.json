It is not reasonably possible to use a method of disposal of the GNF other than land application. 3. The land application is not on or into a grassed waterway that provides a path of flow to surface water. 4. The land application is done in accordance with subsection (2). 5. Written advance notice of the land application is given in accordance with subsection (3). O. Reg. 300/14, s.43 (1); O. Reg. 234/15, s. 13.

The application shall be done, i. if the land is covered with a living crop or at least 30 per cent of the surface of the land is covered with crop residue, A. by injection, B. by spreading and incorporation on the same day, or C. by application to the surface, or ii. in any other case, A. by injection, or B. by spreading and incorporation on the same day. 2. The setback from the top of the bank of surface water shall be 20 metres or more. 3. If the maximum sustained slope of the land is greater than 3 per cent, the GNF shall not be applied within 100 metres from the top of the bank of surface water. 4. The rate of land application shall be such that the total amount of the plant available nitrogen in the GNF, as determined in accordance with the GNF Management Protocol and the GNF Sampling and Analysis Protocol, that is applied during the restricted period does not exceed 17 kilograms per hectare. 5. No person shall apply GNF to land that meets either of the following descriptions: i. The land is subject to flooding once or more every five years according to flood plain mapping provided by the municipality or conservation authority having jurisdiction over the land. ii. The land is where water collects during a rainstorm or thaw and flows directly into surface water. (3) The following rules govern the written advance notice required by paragraph 5 of subsection (1): 1. The notice shall be given by a controller of the agricultural operation in respect of which a condition mentioned in paragraph 1 of subsection (1) is satisfied to the local district office of the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change in whose territory the land is located, not more than seven days before the start of the land application. 2. The notice shall, i. identify the specific day or days on which the land application is to take place, ii. include the name of the individual who will apply the GNF to land and his or her contact information, iii. if the individual mentioned in subparagraph ii acts as an employee of or agent for a corporation or another individual, include that corporation’s or individual’s name and contact information, iv. state an estimate of the amount of GNF to be applied to land and of the land application rate, v. identify the area where the GNF will be applied to land, by lot, concession and roll number, vi. describe any living crop or crop residue in the area where the GNF will be applied to land, vii. explain why land application of the GNF is necessary and indicate what other options were considered, viii. include the name and contact information for the agricultural operation that provided the GNF and the registration number assigned to the farm unit of the greenhouse operation that generated the GNF, ix. include the name and contact information of the controller who is giving the notice, and x. identify the land on which the GNF to be applied is stored by lot, concession and roll number.
