R.S.O. 1990, c. F.17, s. 18(2); 1991, c. 45, s. 2(1).

Contents and service of order (8) An order made by an officer under subsection (2) or (7) shall set out the reasons for the order, the action required to be taken, the time for compliance with the order and the right to request a review of the order and to apply for a hearing and appeal under this section, and a copy of the order shall be served upon the owner and occupant of the building, other structure or premises. Direction by Fire Marshal (9) Where an order made under clause (2)(d) requires the closing of a building, other structure or premises and the Fire Marshal is of the opinion that it is necessary for the immediate protection of persons and property that the building, other structure or premises should be closed forthwith, the Fire Marshal may direct that the building, other structure or premises be closed forthwith and remain closed until the corrective action required by the order has been taken or an appeal from the order is heard and determined.

Extension of time (13) The Fire Code Commission may extend the time for making an application under subsection (11) either before or after expiration of the time fixed in subsection (11), where it is satisfied that there are apparent grounds for granting relief to the applicant pursuant to a hearing and that there are reasonable grounds for applying for the extension and may give the directions that it considers proper consequent upon the extension, but no application for extension of time shall be made more than thirty days after the order appealed from was made or amended. Lifting of stay (14) The Fire Code Commission may, upon application therefor which may be made without notice, order that the order appealed from be not stayed pending the outcome of the appeal but shall take effect immediately where, in its opinion, the action is necessary in the interest of public safety. Appeal to Divisional Court (15) Any party to the hearing before the Fire Code Commission under subsection (12) may appeal from the decision of the Commission to the Divisional Court in accordance with the rules of court. Minister entitled to be heard (16) The Minister is entitled to be heard, by counsel or otherwise, upon the argument of an appeal under subsection (15).

Powers of Ontario Court (Provincial Division) (19) Where an order is not complied with within thirty days after conviction under subsection (18), the Ontario Court (Provincial Division) may, upon application by the Fire Marshal or an officer which may be made without notice, order the closing or removal of the building, other structure or premises or the removal of any substance, material or thing from it where, in its opinion, such action is necessary in the interest of public safety. R.S.O. 1990, c. F.17, s. 18(12-19). Municipal costs may be collected as municipal taxes (20) If an order made under subsection (19) relates to land or premises in a municipality, the municipality shall have a lien on the land or premises for amounts spent by the municipality in carrying out the order and the amounts shall be deemed to be municipal taxes and may be added by the clerk of the municipality to the collector’s roll and collected in the same way and with the same priorities as municipal taxes. Provincial costs may be collected as municipal taxes (20.1) If an order made under subsection (19) relates to land or premises in a municipality and the Fire Marshal instructs the municipality to recover amounts spent by the Province of Ontario in carrying out the order, the municipality shall have a lien on the land or premises for those amounts and they shall be deemed to be municipal taxes and shall be added by the clerk of the municipality to the collector’s roll and collected in the same way and with the same priorities as municipal taxes. Idem (20.2) A lien created under subsection (20.1) in favour of a municipality is not an estate or interest of the Crown within the meaning of clause 9(5)(b) of the Municipal Tax Sales Act. Idem (20.3) Subject to subsection (20.5), money collected in accordance with subsection (20.1), less the costs reasonably attributable to the collection, shall be paid by the municipality to the Treasurer of Ontario. Definition: cancellation price (20.4) In subsections (20.5) and (20.6), “cancellation price” has the same meaning as in the Municipal Tax Sales Act. Proceeds of tax sale (20.5) If there is a sale of land under the Municipal Tax Sales Act and amounts are payable out of the proceeds to the Treasurer of Ontario under this Act, the Environmental Protection Act or the Ontario Water Resources Act, those amounts shall not be paid until after payment of all other amounts payable out of the proceeds in respect of the cancellation price of the land. Cancellation price (20.6) Despite any provision of the Municipal Tax Sales Act, the treasurer of a municipality may sell land under that Act for less than the cancellation price, so long as the land is not sold for less than what the cancellation price would have been but for this Act, the Environmental Protection Act and the Ontario Water Resources Act, and the purchaser may be declared to be the successful purchaser under the Municipal Tax Sales Act. 1991, c. 45, s. 2(2). Service and posting of notice (21) Where an order or direction made under subsection (2), (9) or (19) requires the closing of a building, other structure or premises, a copy of the order or direction shall be served upon the owner if the owner’s whereabouts in Ontario are known and shall be posted on the building, other structure or premises and no person shall enter the building, other structure or premises or remove such copy unless authorized by the Fire Marshal or an officer.

Fine (23) Every person who hinders or disturbs the Fire Marshal or an officer in the exercise of his or her duties under this section is liable on conviction under section 15 to a fine of not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or to both. Restraining order (24) Where it appears to the Fire Marshal or an officer that any person does not comply with an order made under this section, despite the imposition of any penalty in respect of the noncompliance and in addition to any other rights he or she may have, the Fire Marshal or officer may apply to a judge of the Ontario Court (General Division) for an order directing the person to comply with the order, and upon the application, the judge may make such order as the judge thinks fit. Appeal (25) An appeal lies to the Divisional Court from an order made under subsection (24). Service of notice, etc. (26) Where any notice, order, direction or other document is authorized or required to be given, served or delivered to a person under this section, the document may be served personally or by mail addressed to the person or the person’s agent for service at the last known address of the person or agent and, where service is by mail, the service shall be deemed to have been made on the fifth day after the day of mailing unless the person or the agent for service establishes that the person or person’s agent did not, acting in good faith, through absence, accident, illness or other cause beyond their control receive the document until a later date.
