Failure to pay severance pay (21) If a trade union has entered into a settlement agreement under subsection (18) and the employer does not pay the severance pay agreed to or the trade union demonstrates that the agreement was made as the result of fraud or coercion, an employment standards officer may make an order under section 65 as to what action, if any, the employer shall take and may make an order to compensate the employee for the severance pay that is owed. Calculation of severance pay (22) For purposes of subsection (21), the amount of severance pay an employee is entitled to in an order under section 65 is the amount as calculated under subsection (4) or as negotiated in the collective agreement, whichever is the greater. 1991, c. 16, s. 4. No offence (23) An employer does not commit an offence under subsection 78 (1) when his, her or its employees are deemed to have been terminated under subsection (1.1) and the employer does not comply with subsection (2). Same (24) An officer, director or agent of a corporation or a person purporting to act in any such capacity does not commit an offence under subsection 79 (1) when the corporation is an employer whose employees are deemed to have been terminated under subsection (1.1) and the corporation does not comply with subsection (2). 1995, c. 1, s. 75 (2).

Interim orders (23) If, during a review of an order requiring the payment of money or a review of a refusal to issue such an order, the Board finds that a certain amount of wages or compensation is owing or that there is no dispute that a certain amount of wages or compensation is owing, the Board shall, even though the review is not completed, affirm the order or issue an order to the extent of that amount. Interest (24) If the Board issues, amends or affirms an order requiring the payment of money, the Board may order the person against whom the order was issued to pay interest at the rate and calculated in the manner determined by the Director under section 61.1.
