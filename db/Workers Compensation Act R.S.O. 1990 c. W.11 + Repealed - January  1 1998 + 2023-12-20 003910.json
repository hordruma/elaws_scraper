Vocational rehabilitation (2) The spouse of a deceased worker may apply to the Board within one year after the worker’s death for a vocational rehabilitation assessment, and after an assessment the Board shall provide a vocational rehabilitation program to the spouse if the Board considers it appropriate to do so. R.S.O. 1990, c. W.11, s. 35 (1, 2). Idem (3) Subsections 53(11), (12) and (13) apply with respect to a vocational rehabilitation program provided to a spouse. R.S.O. 1990, c. W.11, s. 35 (3); 1994, c. 24, s. 6. Spouse with children (4) Where a deceased worker is survived by a spouse and one or more children, compensation in an amount equal to 90 per cent of the deceased worker’s net average earnings at the time of injury shall be payable to the spouse until the youngest child reaches the age of nineteen. Spouse, no children (5) Where the deceased worker is survived by a spouse and no child or children, the spouse shall be entitled to a periodic payment of 40 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker adjusted by the addition of 1 per cent of the net average earnings for each year of age of the spouse over forty years at the time of the worker’s death or by the subtraction of 1 per cent of the net average earnings for each year of age of the spouse under forty years at the time of the worker’s death, but in no case shall the spouse receive a periodic payment of more than 60 per cent or less than 20 per cent of net average earnings of the deceased worker. Dependent children, no spouse (6) Where there is no spouse entitled to compensation or the spouse dies and the deceased worker, (a) is survived by only one dependent child, the dependent child is entitled to compensation equal to 30 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of injury; or (b) is survived by more than one dependent child, the dependent children are entitled as a class to compensation equal to 30 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of the injury, plus an additional amount of 10 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of injury for each additional dependent child over one to a maximum of 90 per cent of the net average earnings. Idem (7) Where, at the time of the death of the worker, there is no spouse entitled to receive a lump sum payment under clause (1)(a), the worker’s dependent child or children shall be entitled to receive in aggregate a total lump sum payment of $40,000 in addition to the compensation payable under subsection (6). Dependants, no spouse or children (8) Where a deceased worker is not survived by a spouse or by a dependent child or children and there are dependants, the dependants are entitled to reasonable compensation proportionate to the loss occasioned to the dependants by the death as determined by the Board, but in no case shall the total compensation exceed 50 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of injury, and the compensation shall be payable only so long as the worker could have been reasonably expected to continue to support the dependant or dependants if the deceased worker had not suffered injury. Burial expenses (9) Payment shall be made for the necessary expenses of burial or cremation of a deceased worker, as determined by the Board, which amount shall not be less than $1,500, and, where owing to the circumstances of the case the body of a worker is transported for a considerable distance for burial or cremation, a further sum, as determined by the Board, shall be paid for the necessary extra expenses so incurred. Recalculation of spousal periodic payments (10) Subject to subsection (11), where compensation has been paid under subsection (4) and no child is under the age of nineteen years, the spouse shall be entitled to payment of compensation under subsection (5) as if the worker had died on the day after the day the youngest child then living reached the age of nineteen years. Education of children (11) Where the Board is satisfied that it is advisable for a child or children over the age of nineteen to continue education, the Board shall pay in respect of each such child 10 per cent of the net average earnings of the worker at the time of the injury but the total benefit in respect of the spouse and such children shall not exceed 90 per cent of the net average earnings of the worker at the time of the injury. When child payments cease (12) Subject to subsections (10), (11) and (14), a monthly payment in respect of a child shall cease when the child attains the age of nineteen years or when the Board is satisfied that it is not advisable for a child over the age of nineteen to continue receiving an education. Person in the role of parent (13) Where a child or children is or are entitled to compensation under this section and is or are being maintained by a suitable person who is acting in the role of parent in a manner the Board considers satisfactory, such person while so doing is entitled to receive the same periodic payments of compensation for himself or herself and the child or children as if the person were a spouse of the deceased and in such case the child’s or children’s part of such payments shall be in lieu of the periodic payments that the child or children would otherwise be entitled to receive and, where there is more than one child and more than one person acting in the role of parent, the Board may in its discretion apportion the payments under this section accordingly and, where this subsection applies, the maximum amount payable under this section shall not exceed 90 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of injury. Invalid child (14) Compensation is payable to an invalid child without regard to the age of the child and shall continue until the child ceases to be an invalid or dies. Deductions for C.P.P. and Q.P.P. payments (15) In calculating the compensation payable by way of periodic payments under this section, the Board shall have regard to any payments of survivor benefits for death caused by injury that are received under the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan in respect of the deceased worker. Separated spouse (16) A person who ceased to be a spouse by reason of living separate and apart from the deceased worker at the time of the worker’s death is entitled to compensation under this section as a spouse where the worker was or would have been required had the worker not died to make support, maintenance or alimony payments under a separation agreement or judicial order. Idem (17) Where there is more than one person entitled to receive periodic or lump sum payments under this section as a spouse and the periodic payments to those persons as provided in this section would in total exceed 90 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of injury and, or, the lump sum payments to these persons as provided in this section would in total exceed $60,000, the total periodic payments shall be limited to 90 per cent of the net average earnings and the total lump sum payments shall be limited to $60,000 and the Board shall apportion payments that are so limited between those entitled in accordance with, (a) the relative degrees of financial and emotional dependance on the deceased at the time of death; (b) the period of separation, if any, from the deceased at the time of death; and (c) the size of the relative entitlements of those so entitled without reference to this subsection. Adjustment (18) The amounts payable under this section as periodic payments shall be increased if the worker’s death occurred on or before the 30th day of June, 1985 by adding thereto a factor of 5 per cent effective the 1st day of July, 1985, but the total periodic payments after the application of this subsection shall not exceed 90 per cent of the net average earnings of the deceased worker at the time of injury, calculated as if the worker’s average earnings were the maximum amount determined under section 38.

Idem (2) Where owing to the shortness of the time during which the worker was in the employment of the employer or the casual nature of the employment or where it is impractical to calculate the average earnings at the time of the accident, regard may be had to the average earnings that during the twelve months prior to the accident was being earned by a person in the same grade employed at the same work by the same employer or, if there is no person so employed, then by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment in the same locality. Idem (3) Where the worker has entered into concurrent contracts of service with two or more employers under which the worker worked at one time for one of them and at another time for another of them, the worker’s average earnings shall be calculated on the basis of what the worker probably would have been earning if the worker had been employed solely in the employment of the employer for whom the worker was working at the time of the accident. Definition (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), “employed at the same work by the same employer” means employment by the same employer in the grade in which the worker was employed at the time of the accident uninterrupted by absence from work due to illness or any other unavoidable cause. Special expenses (5) Where the employer was accustomed to paying the worker a sum to cover any special expenses entailed on the worker by the nature of the employment, that sum shall not be reckoned as part of the worker’s earnings.

            "content": "43.(1) A worker who suffers injury resulting in permanent impairment or resulting in temporary disability for twelve continuous months is entitled to compensation for future loss of earnings arising from the injury. Duration of compensation (2) An injured worker ceases to be eligible for compensation for future loss of earnings when the worker reaches sixty-five years of age. Amount of compensation (3) Subject to subsection (8), the amount of compensation payable to a worker for future loss of earnings arising from an injury is equal to 90 per cent of the difference between, (a) the worker’s net average earnings before the injury; and (b) the net average earnings that the worker is likely to be able to earn after the injury in suitable and available employment. R.S.O. 1990, c. W.11, s. 43 (1-3). Application of subs. (3) (4) In applying subsection (3) the following rules apply if the amount determined under clause (3) (b) is not zero and does not consist solely of payments described in clause (7) (b): 1. The net average earnings in clause (3) (a) shall be adjusted by applying the indexing factor described in subsection 148 (1.3), for each January 1 since the day of the injury. 2. The amount of compensation calculated under subsection (3) shall be adjusted by, i. multiplying, for each January 1 since the day of the injury, by the sum of one plus the indexing factor described in subsection 148 (1) expressed as a fraction, and ii. dividing, for each January 1 since the day of the injury, by the sum of one plus the indexing factor described in subsection 148 (1.3) expressed as a fraction. Same (5) In applying subsection (3) the following rule applies if the amount determined under clause (3) (b) is zero or consists solely of payments described in clause (7) (b): 1. The net average earnings in clause (3) (a) shall be adjusted by applying the indexing factor described in subsection 148 (1.3), for each January 1 since the day of the injury. Same (6) Subsections (4) and (5) apply in both an initial determination and in a review of a determination under subsection (13). Indexing (6.1) The amount of compensation payable under this section shall be adjusted on January 1 each year, (a) if subsection (4) applied in the last calculation of compensation, by applying the indexing factor described in subsection 148 (1) for each January 1 since the compensation was last determined or reviewed; (b) if subsection (5) applied in the last calculation of compensation, by applying the indexing factor described in subsection 148 (1.3) for each January 1 since the compensation was last determined or reviewed. 1994, c. 24, s. 8 (1). Earnings from suitable and available employment (7) For the purposes of subsection (3), in determining the amount that a worker is likely to be able to earn in suitable and available employment, the Board shall have regard to, (a) the net average earnings, if any, of the worker at the time the Board determines compensation under this section; (b) any disability payments the worker may receive for the injury under the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan; (c) the personal and vocational characteristics of the worker; (d) the prospects for successful medical and vocational rehabilitation of the worker; (e) what constitutes suitable and available employment for the worker; and (f) such other factors as may be prescribed in the regulations. Election re: older workers (8) A worker may elect to receive an amount equal to a full monthly pension for old age security under section 3 of the Old Age Security Act (Canada), including amendments thereto, instead of the amount of compensation determined under subsection (3) or (13) if the worker, (a) is at least fifty-five years of age when the Board determines or reviews the amount of the worker’s compensation; (b) has not returned to work; and (c) is unlikely, in the opinion of the Board, to benefit from a vocational rehabilitation program which could help the worker return to work. Supplement to compensation (9) If a worker who is receiving compensation under this section is co-operating in a Board-authorized vocational or medical rehabilitation program, (a) that began before the date of the Board’s review under clause (13)(a); or (b) that began within twelve months after a determination is made under subsection 42(21) of an unanticipated deterioration in the worker’s condition, the amount of compensation otherwise determined under this section shall be supplemented so that the total compensation payable to the worker while the worker is co-operating in the rehabilitation program is equal to 90 per cent of the worker’s pre-injury net average earnings. Determination of compensation (10) Where possible, the Board shall determine the amount of compensation payable to a worker under this section, (a) in the twelfth consecutive month during which the worker is temporarily disabled; (b) within one year after notice of the accident in which the worker was injured is given under section 22, if during that year the Board determines that the worker is permanently impaired; or (c) within eighteen months after notice of the accident in which the worker was injured is given under section 22, if the worker’s medical condition precludes a determination within the time stated in clause (a) or (b), whichever applies. R.S.O. 1990, c. W.11, s. 43 (7-10). Idem (11) Clauses (10)(b) and (c) do not apply with respect to a worker who is permanently impaired by occupational disease. R.S.O. 1990, c. W.11, s. 43 (11); 1994, c. 24, s. 8 (2). Idem (12) The Board may extend the time limits set out in subsection (10) in the case of a worker who is not receiving compensation under this Act and whose entitlement to compensation is in dispute. Review of amount of compensation (13) Where possible, the Board shall review its determination of the amount of compensation payable to a worker under this section, (a) in the twenty-fourth month after the date of its initial determination; (b) in the sixtieth month after the date of its initial determination; and (c) within twenty-four months after a reconsideration of the percentage of permanent impairment of a worker, under subsection 42(21), results in a determination of increased permanent impairment of the worker, but the Board shall not vary the amount of compensation payable as a result of a review unless the amount of the variation would be equal to at least 10 per cent of the amount of compensation being paid at the time of the review. Payment of compensation (14) Compensation for future loss of earnings is payable in monthly or other periodic payments except as provided in subsection (15). Commutation of amount payable (15) If, following the review under clause (13)(b) or (c), the amount of compensation determined to be payable to a worker under this section is 10 per cent or less of the amount of compensation payable for full loss of earnings, the Board may commute the periodic amount payable to the worker to a lump sum unless the worker elects to receive the compensation in periodic payments.

Apportionment of burden of assessment to hazard of business, etc. (2) Where in the opinion of the Board the hazard to workers in any of the industries embraced in a class is less than that in another or others of such industries, or where for any other reason it is deemed proper to do so, the Board may subdivide the class into subclasses or groups and, if that is done, the Board may fix the percentages or proportions of the contributions to the accident fund that are to be payable by the employers in each subclass or group.

Collection and application of additional percentage (5) Any additional percentage levied and collected under subsection (4) shall be added to the accident fund or applied in reduction of the assessment upon the other employers in the class or subclass to which the employer from whom it is collected belongs as the Board may determine. Merit system (6) Where, in the opinion of the Board, the ways, works, machinery and appliances in any industry conform to modern standards in such manner as to reduce the hazard of accidents to a minimum and the Board is convinced that all proper precautions are being taken by the employer for the prevention of accidents, and where the accident record of the employer has in fact been consistently good, the Board may reduce the amount of any contribution to the accident fund for which such employer is liable. Recommendations (7) The Board may take into account recommendations made by the Workplace Health and Safety Agency established under the Occupational Health and Safety Act in reaching its opinion under subsection (4) or (6).

Last employer may bring in former employers (4) If the employer alleges that the disease was in fact contracted while the worker was in the employment of some other employer, the employer may bring such other employer before the Board and, if the allegation is proved, that other employer is the employer by whom the compensation shall be paid. Where disease result of gradual process (5) If the disease is of such a nature as to be contracted by a gradual process, any other employers who employed the worker in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due are liable to make to the employer by whom the compensation is payable such contributions as the Board may determine to be just. Fixing of compensation (6) The amount of the compensation shall be fixed with reference to the average earnings of the worker as calculated under the provisions of section 40, but for the purposes of this section, where a worker is no longer engaged in the trade, occupation, profession or calling to which the disease is due, the Board may determine his or her average earnings at an amount that it considers fair and equitable having regard to the average earnings of a fully qualified person engaged in the same trade, occupation, profession or calling to which the disease is due during the twelve months prior to the commencement of disability, but not in any case exceeding the maximum amount of average earnings upon which a loss of earnings may be calculated under section 38. Notice (7) The notice provided for by section 22 shall be given to the employer who last employed the worker in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due and the notice may be given even if the worker has voluntarily left the employment. Charging compensation to particular classes (8) Where the compensation is payable out of the accident fund, the Board shall make such investigation as it considers necessary to ascertain the class or classes against which the compensation should be charged and shall charge or apportion the compensation accordingly. Presumption (9) If the worker at or before the date of the disablement was employed in any process mentioned in the second column of Schedule 3 and the disease contracted is the disease in the first column of the Schedule set out opposite to the description of the process, the disease shall be deemed to have been due to the nature of that employment unless the contrary is proved. Idem (10) If the worker at or before the date of the disablement was employed in any process mentioned in the second column of Schedule 4 and the disease contracted is the disease in the first column of the Schedule set out opposite to the description of the process, the disease shall be conclusively deemed to have been due to the nature of the employment.

Condition upon which compensation granted (12) Nothing in this Act entitles a worker or his or her dependants to compensation, health care or payment of burial expenses for impairment or death from silicosis unless the worker has been actually exposed to silica dust in his or her employment in Ontario for periods amounting in all to at least two years preceding his or her impairment. Agreements for cost sharing (13) Despite any other provision of this Act, the Board may enter into an agreement with the appropriate authority in any jurisdiction in Canada to provide for the apportionment of the costs of the claims for industrial diseases for workers who have had exposure employment in more than one Canadian jurisdiction. Agreements for sharing costs of industrial noise claims (14) Despite any other provision in this Act, the Board may enter into an agreement with the appropriate authority in any other province or territory of Canada to provide for the sharing of costs of industrial noise induced hearing loss claims in proportion to the actual or estimated amount of exposure in Ontario to industrial noise which contributed to the hearing loss.

to be furnished by claimants</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(3) The worker or his or her dependants, if so required, shall furnish the employer mentioned in subsection (2) with such information as to the names and addresses of all the other employers by whom the worker was employed in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due as such worker or his or her dependants may possess, and, if such information is not furnished or is not sufficient to enable that employer to take the proceedings mentioned in subsection (4), that employer upon proving that the disease was not contracted while the worker was in the employer’s employment is not liable to pay compensation.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Last employer may bring in former employers</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(4) If the employer alleges that the disease was in fact contracted while the worker was in the employment of some other employer, the employer may bring such other employer before the Board and, if the allegation is proved, that other employer is the employer by whom the compensation shall be paid.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Where disease result of gradual process</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(5) If the disease is of such a nature as to be contracted by a gradual process, any other employers who employed the worker in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due are liable to make to the employer by whom the compensation is payable such contributions as the Board may determine to be just.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Fixing of compensation</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(6) The amount of the compensation shall be fixed with reference to the average earnings of the worker as calculated under the provisions of section 40, but for the purposes of this section, where a worker is no longer engaged in the trade, occupation, profession or calling to which the disease is due, the Board may determine his or her average earnings at an amount that it considers fair and equitable having regard to the average earnings of a fully qualified person engaged in the same trade, occupation, profession or calling to which the disease is due during the twelve months prior to the commencement of disability, but not in any case exceeding the maximum amount of average earnings upon which a loss of earnings may be calculated under section 38.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Notice</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(7) The notice provided for by section 22 shall be given to the employer who last employed the worker in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due and the notice may be given even if the worker has voluntarily left the employment.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Charging compensation to particular classes</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(8) Where the compensation is payable out of the accident fund, the Board shall make such investigation as it considers necessary to ascertain the class or classes against which the compensation should be charged and shall charge or apportion the compensation accordingly.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Presumption</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(9) If the worker at or before the date of the disablement was employed in any process mentioned in the second column of Schedule 3 and the disease contracted is the disease in the first column of the Schedule set out opposite to the description of the process, the disease shall be deemed to have been due to the nature of that employment unless the contrary is proved.</p> <p

the disease contracted is the disease in the first column of the Schedule set out opposite to the description of the process, the disease shall be conclusively deemed to have been due to the nature of the employment.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Remuneration and expenses of medical officers</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(11) The Board may pay the remuneration and expenses of such medical officers as may be required to carry out the provisions of the regulations under the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i> for the examination of workers or applicants for employment in a mine or mining plant, out of the rates imposed under this Act for payment of silicosis claims.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Condition upon which compensation granted</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(12) Nothing in this Act entitles a worker or his or her dependants to compensation, health care or payment of burial expenses for impairment or death from silicosis unless the worker has been actually exposed to silica dust in his or her employment in Ontario for periods amounting in all to at least two years preceding his or her impairment.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Agreements for cost sharing</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(13) Despite any other provision of this Act, the Board may enter into an agreement with the appropriate authority in any jurisdiction in Canada to provide for the apportionment of the costs of the claims for industrial diseases for workers who have had exposure employment in more than one Canadian jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Agreements for sharing costs of industrial noise claims</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(14) Despite any other provision in this Act, the Board may enter into an agreement with the appropriate authority in any other province or territory of Canada to provide for the sharing of costs of industrial noise induced hearing loss claims in proportion to the actual or estimated amount of exposure in Ontario to industrial noise which contributed to the hearing loss.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Saving</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(15) Nothing in this section affects the right of a worker to compensation in respect of a disease to which this section does not apply if the disease is the result of an injury in respect of which the worker is entitled to compensation under this Part.</p> <p class=\"headnote-e\"><b>Extension of section to pneumoconiosis, etc.</b></p> <p class=\"subsection-e\">(16) The provisions of this section relating to silicosis apply with necessary modifications to

Idem (3) A supplement under subsection (2) is payable for the period during which the worker participates in a Board-approved vocational rehabilitation program. Permanent supplement (4) Subject to subsections (8), (9) and (10), the Board shall give a supplement to a worker, (a) who, in the opinion of the Board, is not likely to benefit from a vocational rehabilitation program in the manner described in subsection (2); or (b) whose earning capacity after a vocational rehabilitation program is not increased to the extent described in subsection (2) in the opinion of the Board.

Same (15) Subsection (14) applies even if the amount of the supplement, as calculated under subsection (9) or (10), is zero. Reduction, pre-1985 injuries (16) The payment under subsection (14), for a worker with a pre-1985 injury, shall be reduced, if necessary, so that the sum of the following amounts does not exceed 75 per cent of the worker’s pre-injury average earnings: 1.
