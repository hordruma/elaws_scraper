Same (3) Where an employer on behalf of whose employees a trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, has been certified as bargaining agent or has given or is entitled to give notice under section 16 or 59, sells his, her or its business, the trade union, or council of trade unions continues, until the Board otherwise declares, to be the bargaining agent for the employees of the person to whom the business was sold in the like bargaining unit in that business, and the trade union or council of trade unions is entitled to give to the person to whom the business was sold a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement or the renewal, with or without modifications, of the agreement then in operation and such notice has the same effect as a notice under section 16 or 59, as the case requires.

Powers of Board before disposing of application (8) Before disposing of any application under this section, the Board may make such inquiry, may require the production of such evidence and the doing of such things, or may hold such representation votes, as it considers appropriate. Where employer not required to bargain (9) Where an application is made under this section, an employer is not required, despite the fact that a notice has been given by a trade union or council of trade unions, to bargain with that trade union or council of trade unions concerning the employees to whom the application relates until the Board has disposed of the application and has declared which trade union or council of trade unions, if any, has the right to bargain with the employer on behalf of the employees concerned in the application. Effect of notice of declaration (10) For the purposes of sections 7, 63, 65, 67 and 132, a notice given by a trade union or council of trade unions under subsection (3) or a declaration made by the Board under subsection (6) has the same effect as a certification under section 10. Successor municipalities (11) Where one or more municipalities as defined in the Municipal Affairs Act are erected into another municipality, or two or more such municipalities are amalgamated, united or otherwise joined together, or all or part of one such municipality is annexed, attached or added to another such municipality, the employees of the municipalities concerned shall be deemed to have been intermingled, and, (a) the Board may exercise the like powers as it may exercise under subsections (6) and (8) with respect to the sale of a business under this section; (b) the new or enlarged municipality has the like rights and obligations as a person to whom a business is sold under this section and who intermingles the employees of two of the person’s businesses; and (c) any trade union or council of trade unions concerned has the like rights and obligations as it would have in the case of the intermingling of employees in two or more businesses under this section.

Exception (16) Despite subsection (15), the Board may consider an application for certification by a trade union as the bargaining agent for employees in a bargaining unit that includes an employee who was in the bargaining unit proposed in the original application if, (a) the position of the employee at the time the original application was made was different from his or her position at the time the new application was made; and (b) the employee would not have been in the bargaining unit proposed in the new application had he or she still been occupying the original position when the new application was made.  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Same (17) Subsection (15) does not apply if the trade union whose application was dismissed is a trade union that the Board is prohibited from certifying under section 15.  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Meaning of “trade union” (18) For the purposes of subsections (15) and (16), “trade union” includes any trade union as defined in section 1, whether or not the trade union is a trade union as defined in section 126.  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Non-application of certain provisions (19) Sections 8, 8.1 and 10 do not apply in respect of a certification application that the trade union has elected to have dealt with under this section.  2005, c. 15, s. 8.

Second withdrawal: mandatory bar (22) Subsections 7 (9.1), (9.2) and (9.3) apply, with necessary modifications, if the trade union withdraws an application for certification in the circumstances described in subsection (21) and had withdrawn a previous application for certification not more than six months earlier.  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Withdrawal of application after vote taken: mandatory bar (23) Subsections 7 (10), (10.1) and (10.2) apply, with necessary modifications, if the trade union withdraws the application for certification after a representation vote is taken in accordance with the Board’s direction under subsection (12) or clause (13) (b).  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Industrial, commercial and institutional sector (24) If an election under this section is made in relation to an application for certification that relates to the industrial, commercial and institutional sector of the construction industry referred to in the definition of “sector” in section 126, (a) the references to “trade union” in subsections (1), (2), (4), (7), (8), (10) to (14), (17) and (19) to (23) shall be read as references to the trade unions on whose behalf the application for certification was brought; (b) if the Board certifies the trade unions on whose behalf the application for certification was brought as the bargaining agent of the employees in the bargaining unit under clause (13) (a), it shall issue one certificate that is confined to the industrial, commercial and institutional sector and another certificate in relation to all other sectors in the appropriate geographic area or areas; (c) if the Board directs that a representation vote be taken and more than 50 per cent of the ballots cast in the representation vote are cast in favour of the trade unions on whose behalf the application was brought, the Board shall certify the trade unions as the bargaining agent of the employees in the bargaining unit and shall issue one certificate that is confined to the industrial, commercial and institutional sector and another certificate in relation to all other sectors in the appropriate geographic area or areas; and (d) if the Board dismisses the application for certification under clause (14) (e), the Board shall not consider another application for certification by the employee bargaining agency or the affiliated bargaining agent or agents to certify the trade unions as bargaining agent for the employees in the bargaining unit until one year after the dismissal.  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Same (25) For the purposes of subsection (24), the terms “affiliated bargaining agent” and “employee bargaining agency” have the same meanings as in subsection 151 (1).  2005, c. 15, s. 8. Transition (26) This section applies in respect of applications made on or after the day section 8 of the Labour Relations Statute Law Amendment Act, 2005 comes into force.  2005, c. 15, s. 8.

An order under paragraph 5 does not affect the preparation of another list and the giving of other notices under subsection (1) even if they relate to the same project.  1998, c. 8, s. 21; 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (4, 5).

A bargaining agent that gives notice of approval or disapproval shall also give a copy of the notice to the Board. 3. The proposed agreement is approved if the agreement is approved by at least 60 per cent of the bargaining agents that gave notice, either of approval or disapproval, within the time period for doing so. 4.

If the proponent determines that the proposed agreement has been approved, the proponent shall forthwith give notice that the proposed agreement has been approved to every bargaining agent on the list and shall give the Board a copy of the notice and evidence, in such form as the Board requires, that the notice has been given to each bargaining agent on the list. 6. If the proponent determines that the proposed agreement has not been approved, the proponent shall forthwith give notice that the proposed agreement has not been approved to every bargaining agent on the list and shall give the Board a copy of the notice.  1998, c. 8, s. 21; 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (7).

The Board shall make an order either declaring that the proposed project agreement is in force or declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force. 2. Paragraphs 3 and 4 apply if, i. the bargaining agent challenging the proposed project agreement gave notice of disapproval of the project agreement, and ii. the proposed project agreement would result in a reduction in the total wages and benefits, expressed as a rate, of an employee represented by the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement that is larger, proportionally, than the largest reduction that would apply to an employee represented by a bargaining agent that gave notice of approval of the project agreement. 3. In the circumstances described in paragraph 2, the Board shall make an order doing the following, unless the Board considers it inappropriate to do so, i. amending the proposed project agreement so that no reduction in the total wages and benefits, expressed as a rate, of an employee represented by the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement is greater, proportionally, than the largest reduction that would apply to an employee represented by a bargaining agent that gave notice of approval of the project agreement, and ii. declaring that the proposed project agreement, as amended, is in force. 4. In the circumstances described in paragraph 2, if the Board considers it inappropriate to make an order under paragraph 3, the Board may make an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force. 5. The Board may make an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force if the requirements of subsections (1) to (8) have not been satisfied and the failure to satisfy the requirements affected the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement. 6.

Notice of agreement in force (11) If the project agreement comes into force, the proponent shall forthwith give notice that the project agreement is in force to the agents and agencies described in subsection (13).  1998, c. 8, s. 21; 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (7). Notice of order not to come into force (12) If the Board makes an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force, the proponent shall forthwith give notice of that order to the agents and agencies described in subsection (13).  1998, c. 8, s. 21; 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (7). Who notices given to (13) The agents and agencies referred to in subsections (11) and (12) are the bargaining agents, employee bargaining agencies and employer bargaining agencies to which notice was given under subsection (1).  1998, c. 8, s. 21. Effect of agreement (14) The following apply with respect to projects to which a project agreement applies: 1. The project agreement applies to all construction work on the project that is within the jurisdiction of a bargaining agent on the list. 2. Each applicable provincial agreement, as modified by the project agreement, applies to the construction work on the project, even with respect to employers who would not otherwise be bound by the provincial agreement. 3. Subject to the project agreement, if a provincial agreement ceases to apply while the project agreement is in effect, the provincial agreement that applied when the project agreement was approved applies to the construction work on the project until a new provincial agreement is made.  However, this paragraph does not apply with respect to provincial agreements that apply to work that the project agreement does not apply to. 4. No employees performing work to which the project agreement applies shall strike and no employer shall lock-out such employees while the project agreement is in effect even if a strike is called or authorized under subsection 164 (1) or a lock-out is called or authorized under subsection 164 (2). 5. For greater certainty, paragraph 4 does not affect the right to strike of an employee who performs work to which the project agreement does not apply nor does paragraph 4 affect the right of the employer to lock-out such an employee.  1998, c. 8, s. 21; 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (7). Application of subs. (16) (15) Subsection (16) applies if, (a) a trade union is a bargaining agent that received notice of the coming into force of a project agreement under subsection (11); (b) the trade union does not have bargaining rights with respect to employees of an employer; and (c) the employer employs members of the trade union to perform work on a project that is governed by that project agreement.  2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). No certification or voluntary recognition (16) Regardless of whether the work the members of the trade union perform is inside or outside of the construction industry, if the circumstances set out in subsection (15) apply, (a) the employment of the members of the trade union before the project is completed or abandoned shall not be considered in any application for certification by the trade union with respect to the employer; and (b) any agreement under which the employer agrees to employ only members of the trade union for that work before the project is completed or abandoned but not afterwards shall be deemed not to be an agreement voluntarily recognizing the trade union as the exclusive bargaining agent of those employees.  2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). Not voluntary recognition (16.1) A person shall be deemed not to have voluntarily recognized a trade union as an exclusive bargaining agent if, (a) the person is a party to an agreement or operates under an agreement under which an employer agrees to employ members of the trade union to perform work, regardless of whether the work is inside or outside of the construction industry; (b) the trade union is a bargaining agent to which notice of the coming into force of a project agreement was given under subsection (11); and (c) the agreement includes work on a project to which the project agreement applies.  2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). Not party to collective agreement (17) The proponent and, if the proponent is an agent, the person who owns or has an interest in the land for which the project is planned, are not, only by reason of being a party or operating under the project agreement or an agreement that includes work on the project, parties to any collective agreement.  2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). Same, project agreement (17.1) Subsections (15) to (17) apply with respect to agreements entered into before the day subsection 35 (8) of the Labour Relations Amendment Act, 2000 is proclaimed in force.  2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). Definition (18) In this section, “proponent” means a person who owns or has an interest in the land for which the project is planned and includes an agent of such a person.  1998, c. 8, s. 21.
