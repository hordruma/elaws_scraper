O. Reg. 155/09, s. 33 (3). (4) In the case of a French-language district school board, the board’s distance amount is the sum of the following two numbers: 1. The product of, i. the 2009-2010 day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils of the board, and ii. the greater of $174.35 and the board’s distance factor per elementary school pupil. 2. The product of, i. the 2009-2010 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board, and ii. the greater of $174.35 and the board’s distance factor per secondary school pupil.  O. Reg. 155/09, s. 33 (4). (5) The board’s distance factor per elementary school pupil is the amount determined by multiplying the urban factor specified for the board in Column 3 of Table 6 by the amount determined under the following paragraph that applies to the board: 1. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is less than 151 kilometres, the amount is zero. 2. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 151 kilometres but less than 650 kilometres, the amount is determined using the formula: (A – 150) × $1.06746 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 3. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 650 kilometres but less than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is determined using the formula: [(A – 650) × $0.14366] + $533.73 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 4. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is $605.56.  O. Reg. 155/09, s. 33 (5). (6) The board’s distance factor per secondary school pupil is the amount determined by multiplying the urban factor specified for the board in Column 3 of Table 6 by the amount determined under the following paragraph that applies to the board: 1. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is less than 151 kilometres, the amount is zero. 2. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 151 kilometres but less than 650 kilometres, the amount is determined using the formula: (A – 150) × $1.06746 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 3. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 650 kilometres but less than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is determined using the formula: [(A – 650) × $0.14366] + $533.73 in which, “A” is the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6. 4. If the distance specified for the board in Column 2 of Table 6 is equal to or greater than 1,150 kilometres, the amount is $605.56.  O. Reg. 155/09, s. 33 (6). (7) The board’s dispersion amount is the amount calculated using the following formula: 1. In the case of a board that is neither an ETFO board nor a non-qualifying OSSTF board within the meaning of section 7, (DD – F) × ADE × $5.61662 2. In the case of a board that is an ETFO board but is not a non-qualifying OSSTF board within the meaning of section 7, [(DD – F) × ADEE × $5.57401] + [(DD – F) × ADES × $5.61662] 3. In the case of a board that is a non-qualifying OSSTF board but is not an ETFO board within the meaning of section 7, [(DD – F) × ADEE × $5.61662] + [(DD – F) × ADES × $5.57401] 4. In the case of a board that is both an ETFO board and a non-qualifying OSSTF board within the meaning of section 7, (DD – F) × ADE × $5.57401 O. Reg. 352/09, s. 9. (8) In the formulas set out in subsection (7), “DD” is the dispersion distance in kilometres set out in Column 4 of Table 6 opposite the name of the board in Column 1 of that Table, “F” is the lesser of “DD” and 14 kilometres, “ADE” is the 2009-2010 day school average daily enrolment of pupils of the board, “ADEE” is the 2009-2010 day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils of the board, and “ADES” is the 2009-2010 day school average daily enrolment of secondary school pupils of the board.

(6) The following rules apply in determining the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher: 1. The number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2009-2010 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number. 2. If the number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher exceeds 10, the number of full years of teaching experience of the teacher is deemed to be 10. 3. The number of full years of teaching experience of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be 10.  O. Reg. 155/09, s. 40 (6). (7) The following rules apply, as of October 31, 2009, to determine the qualification category of a teacher: 1. If a board uses an AEFO certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that AEFO certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 2. If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2005 Data Form A is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2009 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2009-2010 school year and October 31, 2009, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section. 9.
