(2) A transaction or series of transactions shall be deemed to constitute a transfer described in subsection (1), (a) if, as a result of the transaction or series of transactions, a municipal corporation or a municipal electricity utility ceases to own the interest in property described in subsection (1) and another person acquires a similar interest in the property; and (b) if it is reasonable to conclude that one of the primary purposes of the transaction or the series of transactions is to avoid the application of subsection 94 (1) of the Act.  O. Reg. 124/99, s. 2 (2). (3) When a corporation ceases to be a subsidiary of a municipal electricity utility, the corporation’s interest in property described in subsection (1) shall be deemed to have been transferred from the corporation to another person immediately before the corporation ceases to be such a subsidiary.  The deemed transfer of the interest in property from the corporation shall be deemed to constitute a transfer described in subsection (1).  O. Reg. 124/99, s. 2 (3). (4) If a municipal corporation or a municipal electricity utility transfers an interest in property described in subsection (1) to a partnership, a portion of the interest in property that is transferred shall be deemed to constitute a transfer described in subsection (1).  The portion that is deemed to be transferred is calculated using the formula, A × ( B / C ) where, “A” is the fair market value of the interest in property described in subsection (1) that the municipal corporation or municipal electricity utility transfers to the partnership; “B” is the fair market value of that portion of interests in the partnership that are owned by persons other than the municipal corporation or the municipal electricity utility; and “C” is the fair market value of all ownership interests in the partnership. O. Reg. 124/99, s. 2 (4). (5) If a corporation (the “successor corporation”) is formed as a result of the amalgamation or merger of two or more corporations (the “predecessor corporations”), an interest in property described in subsection (1) that is held by a predecessor corporation immediately before the amalgamation or merger shall be deemed to have been transferred to the successor corporation upon the amalgamation or merger.  That transfer shall be deemed to constitute a transfer described in subsection (1).  O. Reg. 18/00, s. 1. (6) Subsection (5) does not apply with respect to an amalgamation of two or more municipal corporations or municipal electricity utilities, if the amalgamation is required by an Act or is otherwise required by law.  O. Reg. 18/00, s. 1. (7) If a shareholder of a corporation ceases to own a share of the capital stock of the corporation because the corporation redeems, acquires or cancels the share, the shareholder shall be deemed to have transferred to a person other than a municipal electricity utility an interest in the corporation having a fair market value equal to the fair market value of the share.  That transfer shall be deemed to constitute a transfer described in subsection (1).  O. Reg. 18/00, s. 1. (8) If a shareholder of a corporation receives an amount on the reduction of capital in respect of a share of the corporation otherwise than by way of a redemption, acquisition or cancellation of the share, the shareholder shall be deemed to have transferred to a person other than a municipal electricity utility an interest in the corporation having a fair market value equal to the amount received on the reduction of capital.  That transfer shall be deemed to constitute a transfer described in subsection (1).  O. Reg. 18/00, s. 1.

O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (3) On an application made to the Minister of Finance in accordance with this section, a municipal electricity utility is entitled to a refund in the amount determined in accordance with this section with respect to the amount paid by it under subsection 94 (1) of the Act in respect of the transfer of an eligible property if, (a) the municipal electricity utility or an eligible shareholder of the municipal electricity utility acquires a reinvestment property after the transfer and continues to hold it at the time of the application; (b) a refund in respect of the cost or portion of the cost of the reinvestment property to which the application relates has not previously been made under this section to the municipal electricity utility; and (c) the amount of the municipal electricity utility’s refundable balance in respect of the application exceeds nil.

O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (6) If the Minister of Finance determines that a municipal electricity utility is entitled to a refund under this section in respect of the acquisition of a reinvestment property, the Minister of Finance may direct the Financial Corporation to pay to the municipal electricity utility an amount equal to the lesser of, (a) the amount of the municipal electricity utility’s refundable balance in respect of the application, as determined under this section; and (b) 33 per cent of the cost or portion of the cost of the reinvestment property to which the application relates.  O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2.

O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (9) Subject to subsection (11), a municipal electricity utility’s refundable balance is deemed to be nil immediately after the issue or transfer of any shares representing a direct or indirect interest in the municipal electricity utility.

If the amalgamation or merger is with another municipal electricity utility to form a municipal electricity utility and occurs before October 17, 2006, i. the municipal electricity utility formed as a result of the amalgamation or merger shall be considered for the purposes of subsection (10) to be the same as and a continuation of each of its predecessor municipal electricity utilities, and ii. the municipal electricity utility formed as a result of the amalgamation or merger shall have a refundable balance equal to the sum of the refundable balances, if any, of each of its predecessor municipal electricity utilities immediately before the amalgamation or merger.

(12) The cost or portion of the cost of a reinvestment property that is real property under construction for a municipal electricity utility, (a) shall include all costs related to the construction that are incurred by the municipal electricity utility after October 16, 2006 and before the application is made; (b) shall not include any costs incurred by the municipal electricity utility before October 17, 2006 or any progress billings related to the construction paid or payable before that day; and (c) shall be reduced by the amount of any holdbacks the municipal electricity utility has claimed or is entitled to claim in respect of amounts that would otherwise be included in the cost or portion of the cost of the reinvestment property to which the application relates.  O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (13) If the Financial Corporation pays a refund under this section to which a municipal electricity utility is not entitled or pays a refund in an amount in excess of the amount to which the municipal electricity utility is entitled, (a) the refund or portion of the refund to which the municipal electricity utility is not entitled is a liability of the municipal electricity utility; and (b) the Minister may assess the municipal electricity utility for the amount of the liability plus interest from the day the refund was paid to the day the amount of the liability is paid to the Minister, calculated at the rate or rates and in the manner applicable to unpaid taxes under the Corporations Tax Act.  O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (14) For the purposes of subsection (13), a municipal electricity utility shall be considered to have received a refund to which it was not entitled or a refund in an amount in excess of the amount to which it was entitled if it receives a refund under this section in respect of the acquisition of a reinvestment property after the transfer of an eligible property and it is subsequently determined that, (a) subsection 94 (1) of the Act did not apply to the transfer of the eligible property; or (b) the amount payable under subsection 94 (1) of the Act with respect to the transfer of the eligible property is less than the amount used in the calculation of the municipal electricity utility’s refundable balance.  O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (15) No interest is payable to a municipal electricity utility in respect of any amounts refunded under this section.  O. Reg. 470/07, s. 2. (16) An amount paid as a refund under this section shall not be included in computing an amount payable by a municipal electricity utility under section 93 of the Act except to the extent that the refund relates to an amount paid under subsection 94 (1) of the Act that has been claimed or deducted as an outlay or expense by a municipal electricity utility in computing an amount payable under section 93 of the Act for a taxation year.
