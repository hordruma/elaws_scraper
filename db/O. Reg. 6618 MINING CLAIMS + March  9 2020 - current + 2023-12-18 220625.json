(6) If assessment work credits are distributed to a multi-cell claim before a portion of the claim is abandoned, the same number of units of assessment work that were satisfied by the distribution before the partial abandonment shall be deemed to have been satisfied with respect to the portion of the claim that remains after the abandonment.
