(1) This Regulation applies with respect to every plant that is a metal mining plant and that, on or after August 25, 1994, discharges a total volume of process effluent, cooling water effluent and overflow effluent of more than 50 cubic metres. (2) Subject to subsection (4), this Regulation continues to apply to a plant described in subsection (1) even if, (a) production at the plant is interrupted; or (b) the total volume of process effluent, cooling water effluent and overflow effluent discharged from the plant is subsequently reduced to less than 50 cubic metres. (3) Despite subsection (1), as of May 2, 1996 this Regulation does not apply to a plant that, (a) ceased production permanently before August 26, 1994; or (b) “closed out” as defined in subsection 139 (1) of the Mining Act before May 2, 1996. (4) This Regulation ceases to apply to a plant described in subsection (1) on the day on which the plant begins “temporary suspension” as defined in subsection 139 (1) of the Mining Act and begins to apply to the plant again 30 days after production resumes. (5) This Regulation ceases to apply to a plant described in subsection (1) 10 days after the day on which production at the plant ceases permanently. (6) In the case of a planned permanent cessation, each discharger shall provide notice of the cessation to the Director before the cessation. (7) A notice under subsection (6) shall include the date on which the discharger plans to cease production.
