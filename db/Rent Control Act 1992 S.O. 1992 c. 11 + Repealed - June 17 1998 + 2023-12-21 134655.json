Time limited exemption (7) Sections 6, 7, 7.1, 8, 9.1, 103, 107, 108 and 109 are the only sections of this Act that apply to a rental unit in a new residential complex during the period of five years commencing with the day the first rental unit in the residential complex is first rented if, (a) no residential unit in the residential complex is occupied before November 1, 1991; and (b) the landlord gives the tenant of the rental unit the notice described in subsection (7.1), (i) within ninety days following the day this subsection comes into force if, (A) the residential complex is a care home on November 23, 1993, and (B) the tenant is a tenant of the rental unit on the ninetieth day following the day this subsection comes into force, (ii) before entering into a tenancy agreement with the tenant, if subclause (i) does not apply.
