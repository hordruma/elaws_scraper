(1) For the purposes of subsection 84.13 (1) of the Act, the standards described in this section must be considered in equalizing assessments within the classes of real property in the county and in computing the factors resulting from the application of the standards. (2) The proportion that the county and school board taxes levied for 1995 in each class of real property in a county bears to the total county and school board taxes levied for 1995 in the county must be maintained in such a way that the amount calculated using the formula, the sum of A × B by property class for all municipalities within the county that pay county and school board taxes, is substantially the same as the amount calculated using the formula, the sum of C × D by property class for all municipalities within the county that pay county and school board taxes, in which, “A” is the mill rate in each municipality which resulted in the amount of county and school board taxes levied for 1995 against the total assessment in 1995 of all the properties that comprise the class, “B” is the total assessment in each municipality in 1995 of all the properties that comprise the class, “C” is the adjusted mill rate which would have resulted in the amount of county and school board taxes levied for 1995 against the total assessment “D”, and “D” is the total assessment in each municipality of all the properties that comprise the class for the 1996 taxation year following the application of the assessment standards described in this section. (3) All real property within a class in a county must, to the extent possible, be assessed at the same proportion of market value in relation to the base year 1992. (4) For the purpose of subsection (3), market value is as determined by the assessment commissioner in whose assessment region the real property is located. (5) The total taxes collected from the taxable real property in the county, including assessments made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act, must not be substantially changed. (6) The proportion of county and school board taxes paid by each class in the county must not be significantly altered as a result of the application of standards described in this section. (7) Subsection (6) does not apply with respect to changes in assessment relationships that have resulted from an increase in the total assessment of a class because of assessments made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act. (8) The total taxes collected from the taxable real property in the municipality for local purposes must not be substantially changed. O. Reg. 264/96, s. 4.",
