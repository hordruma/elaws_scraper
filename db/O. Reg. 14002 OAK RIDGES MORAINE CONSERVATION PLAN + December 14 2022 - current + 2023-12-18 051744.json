O. Reg. 140/02, s. 30 (8). (9) The landform conservation plan shall also include a development strategy that identifies appropriate planning, design and construction practices to minimize disruption to landform character, including, (a)  retention of significant landform features in an open, undisturbed form; (b)  road alignment and building placement to minimize grading requirements; (c)  concentration of development on portions of the site that are not significant; (d)  use of innovative building design to minimize grading requirements; and (e)  use of selective grading techniques.  O. Reg. 140/02, s. 30 (9). (10) An application for development or site alteration that does not constitute major development, with respect to land in a landform conservation area of either category, shall be accompanied by a site plan that, (a)  identifies the areas within which all building, grading and related construction will occur; (b)  demonstrates that buildings and structures will be located within the areas referred to in clause (a) so as to minimize the amount of site alteration required; and (c)  provides for the protection of areas of natural and scientific interest (earth science) in accordance with subsection (12).

(12) An application for development or site alteration with respect to land in an area of natural and scientific interest (earth science) or the related minimum area of influence shall be accompanied by an earth science heritage evaluation that, (a)  identifies planning, design and construction practices that will ensure protection of the geological or geomorphological attributes for which the area of natural and scientific interest was identified; and (b)  determines whether a minimum vegetation protection zone is required, and if so, specifies the dimensions of that zone and provides for the maintenance and, where possible, improvement or restoration of natural self-sustaining vegetation within it.  O. Reg. 140/02, s. 30 (12). (13) With respect to land in Settlement Areas, in considering applications for development or site alteration within landform conservation areas (Category 1 and 2), the approval authority shall consider the importance of adopting planning, design and construction practices that will keep disturbance to landform character to a minimum, so as to satisfy the requirements of subsections (5) to (11) if possible.

However, prime agricultural lands in other areas must be rehabilitated in accordance with subclause 35 (1) (b) (i). O. Reg. 141/17, s. 26 (2).

O. Reg. 140/02, s. 35 (2).
