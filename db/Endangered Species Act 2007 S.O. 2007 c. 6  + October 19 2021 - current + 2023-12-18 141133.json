A species shall be classified as an extinct species if it no longer lives anywhere in the world. 2.  A species shall be classified as an extirpated species if it lives somewhere in the world, lived at one time in the wild in Ontario, but no longer lives in the wild in Ontario. 3.  A species shall be classified as an endangered species if it lives in the wild in Ontario but is facing imminent extinction or extirpation. 4.  A species shall be classified as a threatened species if it lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered, but is likely to become endangered if steps are not taken to address factors threatening to lead to its extinction or extirpation. 5.  A species shall be classified as a special concern species if it lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered or threatened, but may become threatened or endangered because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats.  2007, c. 6, s. 5 (1). Geographic limitation (2) When COSSARO classifies a species, the classification shall be deemed to apply to all of Ontario unless COSSARO indicates that the classification applies only to a specified geographic area in Ontario.  2007, c. 6, s. 5 (2). Best available scientific information (3) COSSARO shall classify species based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.  2007, c. 6, s. 5 (3). Criteria for classification (4) The criteria for assessing and classifying species as endangered, threatened or special concern species under paragraph 1 of subsection 4 (1) shall include considerations of, (a)  the species’ geographic range in Ontario; and (b)  the condition of the species across the broader biologically relevant geographic range in which it exists both inside and outside of Ontario. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 5, s. 3.

Criteria (3) The Minister may make an order under subsection (1) only if, (a)  before the report was submitted by COSSARO under section 6, the species was not listed as an endangered or threatened species on the Species at Risk in Ontario List; (b)  the Minister is of the opinion that, (i)  the application of the prohibitions would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario and, as a result, additional time is required to determine the best approach to protecting the species and its habitat, and (ii)  the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario; and (c)  the Minister is of the opinion that the species meets at least one of the following criteria: (i)  the species is broadly distributed in the wild in Ontario, (ii)  the amount, quality and availability of the species’ habitat in Ontario is not currently limiting its survival or recovery in Ontario, (iii)  addressing the primary threats to the species is not currently possible or feasible and additional time is needed to assess the best approach to addressing those threats, (iv)  successfully reducing the primary threats to the species requires the cooperation of other jurisdictions and additional time is needed to address the inter-jurisdictional complexities of addressing those threats, or (v)  any other criteria prescribed by the regulations made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 5, s. 7.
