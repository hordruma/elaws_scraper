(6) Safety catches and mechanisms on a cage or skip shall, (a)  be of a type and design that meets good engineering practice; (b)  stop and hold a cage or skip transporting persons should the supporting rope or attachment break; and (c)  be subjected to the tests prescribed in subsection (7) and successfully pass the free fall test prescribed in subsection (8), (i)  prior to the cage or skip first being used to transport persons, and (ii)  prior to the cage or skip first being used after repairs to correct distortion of the safety catches and mechanisms.  R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 854, s. 232 (6); O. Reg. 272/97, s. 42 (1). (7) Free fall tests shall be performed under the following conditions: 1.  The cage or skip must carry a weight equal to its maximum permitted load of persons and any material permitted to be carried at the same time. 2.  The cage or skip must travel at a speed equal to, i.  the normal hoisting speed when transporting persons, or ii.  the speed attained by a free fall of 1.5 metres. 3.  The guides on which the test is made must be of the same specifications as those in the shaft in which the conveyance will operate.  O. Reg. 68/96, s. 6 (1). (7.1) A free fall test shall not be performed at the speed attained by a free fall of 1.5 metres unless the design and configuration of the safety catches and mechanisms and the loading on the cage or skip have been tested at normal hoisting speed before the free fall. O. Reg. 69/23, s. 31 (1). (7.2) If a free fall test is to be performed at the speed attained by a free fall of 1.5 metres, the person performing the test shall record the rate of deceleration and the rate of change in deceleration of the cage or skip on a chart suitable for determining the deceleration of the conveyance.  O. Reg. 68/96, s. 6 (1). (8) A free fall test shall be successfully passed if, (a)  the skip or cage decelerates to a stop at an average rate that is not less than nine or greater than 20 metres per second per second. (b)  there is no damage to the safety catches and mechanisms; (c)  the safety catches and mechanisms engage the guides continuously during deceleration; and (d)  a calculation shows that the safety catches and mechanisms will stop the cage or skip when it is carrying its maximum material load.
