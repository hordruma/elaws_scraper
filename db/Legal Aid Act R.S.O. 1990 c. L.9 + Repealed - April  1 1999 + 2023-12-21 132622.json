Function of assessment officer (3) The assessment officer to whom an application is referred shall consider the income, disposable capital, indebtedness, requirements of persons dependent on the applicant, and such other circumstances as he or she considers to be relevant that are disclosed in the application or that he or she ascertains after investigation, and shall report to the area director as to whether the applicant can pay no part, some part or the whole of the cost of the legal aid applied for and the sum, if any, the applicant is able to contribute towards the cost thereof.
