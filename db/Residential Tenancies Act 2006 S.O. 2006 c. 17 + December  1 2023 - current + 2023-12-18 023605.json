Payment after order becomes enforceable (11) A tenant may make a motion to the Board, on notice to the landlord, to set aside an eviction order referred to in subsection (3) if, after the order becomes enforceable but before it is executed, the tenant pays an amount to the landlord or to the Board and files an affidavit sworn by the tenant stating that the amount, together with any amounts previously paid to the landlord or to the Board, is at least the sum of the following amounts: 1. The amount of rent that is in arrears under the tenancy agreement. 2. The amount of additional rent that would have been due under the tenancy agreement as at the date of payment by the tenant had notice of termination not been given. 3. The amount of NSF cheque charges charged by financial institutions to the landlord in respect of cheques tendered to the landlord by or on behalf of the tenant, as allowed by the Board in an application by the landlord under section 87. 4.

Enforcement costs (15) If, on a motion under subsection (11), the Board determines that the landlord has paid any non-refundable amount under the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the order under subsection (3), the Board shall specify that amount in the order made under clause (14) (a) and shall provide in the order that it is not effective unless, (a) the tenant pays the specified amount into the Board by a date specified in the order; and (b) an employee in the Board issues a notice under subsection (16).  2006, c. 17, s. 74 (15); 2013, c. 3, s. 27 (2).

Failure to pay (17) If subsection (15) applies to an order made under clause (14) (a) and the tenant does not pay the amount specified in the order into the Board by the date specified in the order, the stay of the order under subsection (3) ceases to apply and the order may be enforced.  2006, c. 17, s. 74 (17). Order for payment (18) If the Board makes an order under clause (14) (b), the Board may make an order that the tenant pay to the landlord any non-refundable amount paid by the landlord under the Administration of Justice Act for the purpose of enforcing the order under subsection (3).  2006, c. 17, s. 74 (18).

The member has persistently failed to pay the regular monthly housing charges on the date they became due and payable. 2. The member unit is in a residential complex described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 7 (1) and the member has ceased to meet the qualifications required for occupancy of the member unit. 3. The member fails to pay the regular monthly housing charges lawfully owing with respect to the member unit. 4. The member unit is in a residential complex described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of subsection 7 (1) and the member has knowingly and materially misrepresented his or her income or that of other members of his or her household. 5. The member or another occupant of the member unit commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation or permits a person to do so in the member unit or the residential complex. 6. The member, another occupant of the member unit or a person whom the member permits in the member unit or the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the member unit or the residential complex. 7. The member, another occupant of the member unit or a person whom the member permits in the member unit or the residential complex, i. wilfully causes undue damage to the member unit or the residential complex, or ii. uses the member unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as residential premises and that causes or can reasonably be expected to cause damage that is significantly greater than the damage that is required in order to give a notice of termination under subparagraph i or paragraph 6. 8. The conduct of the member, another occupant of the member unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the member is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the co-operative or another member of the co-operative or occupant of the residential complex or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the co-operative or another such member or occupant. 9. An act or omission of the member, another occupant of the member unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the member seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person and the act or omission occurs in the residential complex. 10. The number of persons occupying the member unit on a continuing basis results in a contravention of health, safety or housing standards required by law. 11. A notice of termination was given to the member for a circumstance described in paragraph 6, 8 or 10 and more than seven days but less than six months after the notice was given, an activity takes place, conduct occurs or a situation arises that constitutes the same circumstance under which the previous notice of termination was given. 2013, c. 3, s. 31; 2017, c. 13, s. 18. Deemed termination of membership and occupancy rights (2) Despite subsections 171.8 (1) and 171.12.1 (2) of the Co-operative Corporations Act, where the circumstance described in paragraph 11 of subsection (1) exists, the memberâs membership and occupancy rights are deemed to have been terminated for the purpose of giving a notice of termination of the memberâs occupancy of a member unit under this section. 2013, c. 3, s. 31. Rent-geared-to-income assistance (3) For greater certainty, paragraph 2 of subsection (1) does not authorize a non-profit housing co-operative to give a member notice of termination of the memberâs occupancy of a member unit on the ground that the member has ceased to be eligible for, or has failed to take any step necessary to maintain eligibility for, rent-geared-to-income assistance as defined in section 38 of the Housing Services Act, 2011. 2016, c. 25, Sched. 5, s. 2.
