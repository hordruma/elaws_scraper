(2)The advisory committee may issue an overtime permit only if the employer applies for it in writing. (3)The advisory committee may not issue an overtime permit, (a) that would permit overtime work that might result in an employee working less than a regular working day or working fewer regular working days unless, before issuing the overtime permit, the advisory committee is of the opinion that the circumstances are exceptional; or (b) that would permit more than 10 hours of work in one day or more than 48 hours of work in one week.

(2)The regular working day that the employer may require an employee to work under subsection (1) is the regular working day that would have applied if the day were not Victoria Day or Canada Day. (3)Subject to subsection (4), if an employee works a regular working day on Victoria Day or Canada Day, the following apply: 1.
