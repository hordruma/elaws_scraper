Determine the Initial Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year by dividing the result obtained under subparagraph vi by the number of properties in municipalities owing a per property amount for the target year that is less than the per property amount owed for the year preceding the target year. viii. If none of the municipalities included in the calculation under subparagraph iv has a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Initial Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under subparagraph vii, the Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year is equal to the Initial Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under subparagraph vii. ix. If any of the municipalities included in the calculation under subparagraph iv has a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Initial Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under subparagraph vii, carry out the calculations required by subparagraphs iv to vii again, but this time exclude the municipalities which have a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Initial Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year. The new amount determined under subparagraph vii as a result of this second calculation is the Second Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year. x. If none of the municipalities included in the second calculation under subparagraph iv (as carried out under subparagraph ix) has a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Second Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined by the second calculation under subparagraph vii (as carried out under subparagraph ix), the Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year is equal to the Second Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined by the second calculation under subparagraph vii. xi. If any of the municipalities included in the second calculation under subparagraph iv (as carried out under subparagraph ix) has a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Second Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined by the second calculation under subparagraph vii (as carried out under subparagraph ix), carry out the calculations required by subparagraphs iv to vii again, but this time exclude the municipalities which have a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Second Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year. The new amount determined under subparagraph vii as a result of this third calculation is the Third Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year. xii. Continue the process, as described in subparagraphs viii to xi, until none of the municipalities included in a calculation under subparagraph iv has a per property decrease for the target year that is less than the Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year that was determined under subparagraph vii as a result of that calculation. xiii. The Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year is equal to the Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year that was determined under subparagraph vii as a result of the last calculation that was required to be carried out under that subparagraph. 11. If the result obtained under paragraph 3 shows that the Per Property Amount Owing by the section 5.1 municipality for the target year has decreased by an amount that is greater than the Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under paragraph 10, then the amount owing by the municipality for police services provided by the OPP under section 5.1 of the Act during the target year is not the amount determined under paragraph 35 of section 4 but is the amount determined as follows: i. Subtract the Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under paragraph 10, from the amount by which the Per Property Amount Owing by the section 5.1 municipality for the target year is less than the Per Property Amount Owed by it for the year preceding the target year, as determined under paragraph 3. ii. Multiply the result obtained under subparagraph i by the number of properties in the municipality in respect of the target year. iii. Calculate the sum of the amount determined under paragraph 35 of section 4 and the result obtained under subparagraph ii. 12. If the result obtained under paragraph 3 shows that the Per Property Amount Owing by the section 5.1 municipality for the target year has decreased by an amount that is less than or equal to the Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under paragraph 10, then the amount owing by the municipality for police services provided by the OPP under section 5.1 of the Act during the target year shall not be adjusted and is the amount determined under paragraph 35 of section 4.",

If the result obtained under paragraph 3 shows that the Per Property Amount Owing by the section 5.1 municipality for the target year has decreased by an amount that is greater than the Final Per Property Reduction Limit for the target year, as determined under paragraph 10, then the amount owing by the municipality for police services provided by the OPP under section 5.1 of the Act during the target year is not the amount determined under paragraph 35 of section 4 but is the amount determined as follows:</p> <p class=\"subpara-e\">  i.
