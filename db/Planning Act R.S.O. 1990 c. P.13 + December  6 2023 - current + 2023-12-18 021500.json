R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13, s. 42 (1). Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, subsection 42 (1) of the Act is amended by adding âSubject to subsection (1.1)â at the beginning. (See: 2022, c. 21, Sched. 9, s. 12 (2)) Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, section 42 of the Act is amended by adding the following subsection: (See: 2022, c. 21, Sched. 9, s. 12 (3)) Same, affordable residential units (1.1) With respect to land proposed for development or redevelopment that will include affordable residential units or attainable residential units, as defined in subsection 4.1 (1) of the Development Charges Act, 1997, or residential units described in subsection 4.3 (2) of that Act, the amount of land that may be required to be conveyed under subsection (1) shall not exceed 5 per cent of the land multiplied by the ratio of A to B where, âAâ is the number of residential units that are part of the development or redevelopment but are not affordable residential units, attainable residential units or residential units described in subsection 4.3 (2) of the Development Charges Act, 1997; and âBâ is the number of residential units that are part of the development or redevelopment. 2022, c. 21, Sched. 9, s. 12 (3).

When requirement determined (2.1) The amount of land or payment in lieu required to be provided under this section is the amount of land or payment in lieu that would be determined under the by-law on, (a) the day an application for an approval of development in a site plan control area under subsection 41 (4) of this Act or subsection 114 (5) of the City of Toronto Act, 2006\r\nwas made in respect of the development or redevelopment; (b) if clause (a) does not apply, the day an application for an amendment to a by-law passed under section 34 of this Act was made in respect of the development or redevelopment; or (c) if neither clause (a) nor clause (b) applies, the day a building permit was issued in respect of the development or redevelopment or, if more than one building permit is required for the development or redevelopment, the day the first permit was issued. 2022, c. 21, Sched. 9, s. 12 (6). Same, if by-law not in effect (2.2) Subsection (2.1) applies regardless of whether the by-law under which the amount of land or payment in lieu would be determined is no longer in effect on the date the land is conveyed, the payment in lieu is made or arrangements for the payment in lieu that are satisfactory to the council are made, as the case may be. 2022, c. 21, Sched. 9, s. 12 (6).
