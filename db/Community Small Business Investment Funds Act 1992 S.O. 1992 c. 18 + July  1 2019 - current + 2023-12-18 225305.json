The investment is made after 2004 in a taxable Canadian corporation or Canadian partnership that is no longer an eligible business only because, at the time the investment is made, the corporation or partnership no longer satisfies the requirements of subclauses (d) (i) and (ii) of the definition of “eligible business” in subsection 12 (1). 2. The only reason the investment would not be an eligible investment under this section, in the absence of this subsection, is because the taxable Canadian corporation or Canadian partnership is no longer an eligible business for the reason set out in paragraph 1. 3. The labour sponsored investment fund corporation made and continues to maintain a previous investment in the taxable Canadian corporation or Canadian partnership that was, at the time the investment was made, an eligible investment under the provisions of this section other than this subsection.  2006, c. 9, Sched. C, s. 4 (2).

C, s. 4 (2). Interpretation, widely held corporation (2) For the purposes of this section, a labour sponsored investment fund corporation shall be deemed to be widely held if the corporation has ten or more shareholders and no shareholder or related group of which a shareholder is a member owns more than 10 per cent of the issued and outstanding voting shares of the corporation.  1992, c. 18, s. 18 (2); 2004, c. 16, s. 1 (2).

Minister’s order (10) Upon application by a labour sponsored investment fund corporation, where the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may, on such terms and conditions as the Minister considers necessary, order that the non-compliance with clause (1) (b), subclause (1) (d) (iii) or (x) or another prescribed provision does not preclude an investment by the corporation from being an eligible investment.  1994, c. 17, s. 85 (4); 1999, c. 9, s. 55 (6); 2004, c. 16, s. 1 (2); 2005, c. 28, Sched.

Contravention of spirit and intent (12) Despite subsection (1) and any order made under subsection (10), if the Minister is of the opinion that a labour sponsored investment fund corporation has directly or indirectly through a transaction or series of transactions contravened the spirit and intent of this Act, the Minister, (a) shall make an order that a particular investment is not an eligible investment as of the date of the transaction or the date of the first transaction in the series of transactions; and (b) may revoke the registration of the labour sponsored investment fund corporation in accordance with section 26 if the Minister has previously made an order referred to in clause (a) in respect of any investment made by the labour sponsored investment fund corporation.  2004, c. 31, Sched. 7, s. 7 (5). Penalty, investment advisor (13) If a labour sponsored investment fund corporation has, by reason of a transaction or series of transactions, contravened a provision of this Act or been found by the Minister under subsection (12) to have contravened the spirit and intent of this Act, the Minister may assess a penalty against every person, other than an employee of the labour sponsored investment fund corporation, who acted on behalf of the labour sponsored investment fund corporation in identifying, investigating, structuring, negotiating the transaction or any transaction in the series of transactions or in administering the investment affairs of the labour sponsored investment fund corporation and who knew or ought to have known that the transaction or series of transactions contravened this Act or was contrary to the spirit and intent of this Act and the amount of any penalty assessed by the Minister shall be, (a) 1.5 per cent of the amount paid by the labour sponsored investment fund corporation in the transaction or series of transactions, up to a maximum of $50,000 on a first contravention; or (b) 3 per cent of the amount paid by the labour sponsored investment fund corporation in the transaction or series of transactions, up to a maximum of $100,000 for each subsequent contravention.  2004, c. 31, Sched. 7, s. 7 (5). Fundamental principles (14) In determining whether an investment contravenes the spirit and intent of the Act, the Minister shall consider the factors that are, in his or her opinion, relevant, including but not limited to the following factors: 1. Whether the labour sponsored investment fund corporation provides direct financial, investment and managerial advice to small and medium-sized Ontario-owned and operated businesses, with the objective of supporting the growth of those businesses. 2. Whether the recipient business has unrestricted access to the capital invested for the operation and development of the business. 3. Whether a material portion of the economic value of the investment for the labour sponsored investment fund corporation is derived, directly or indirectly, from a business other than an eligible business. 4. If an investment has been made indirectly through a subsidiary of the labour sponsored investment fund corporation, whether the subsidiary made a reasonable attempt to invest in small or medium-sized Ontario businesses. 5. Whether a material portion of the investment proceeds were not used by the eligible business before the labour sponsored investment fund corporation disposed of its investment.  2004, c. 31, Sched. 7, s. 7 (5).
