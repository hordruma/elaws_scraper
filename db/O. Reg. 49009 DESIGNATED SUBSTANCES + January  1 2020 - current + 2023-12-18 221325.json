O. Reg. 148/12, s. 3; O. Reg. 288/17, s. 1. Schedule 1 PART I   AIRBORNE MEASUREMENT AND CALCULATION OF EXPOSURE 1. Airborne concentrations of a designated substance are expressed as, (a) parts of the agent per million parts of air by volume (ppm); (b) milligrams of the agent per cubic metre of air (mg/m3); or (c) fibres per cubic centimetre of air (f/cc). 2. In determining exposure to airborne concentrations of the designated substance, no regard shall be had to the wearing or use of respirators. 3. Air sampling of the airborne concentrations of the designated substance is not required for the full period of a work day or a work week if the air sampling is representative of airborne concentrations of the substance likely to be present during the full period. 4. The average concentrations of a designated substance to which a worker is exposed shall be determined from analysis of air samples taken as being representative of the exposure of the worker to the designated substance during work operations. 5. Subject to section 6 of this Schedule, the time-weighted average exposure to an airborne designated substance in a work day or work week shall be calculated as follows: 1. The cumulative daily or weekly exposure shall be calculated using the following formula: C1T1 + C2T2 + ... + CnTn where, C1  is the concentration found in an air sample, and T1  is the total time in hours to which the worker is taken to be exposed to concentration C1 in a work day or a work week. 2. The time-weighted average exposure shall be calculated by dividing the cumulative daily exposure by eight and the cumulative weekly exposure by 40 respectively. 6. A determination of time-weighted average exposure for extended work shifts may be calculated using the methodology set out in the Guide for the Adjustment of Permissible Exposure Values for Unusual Work Schedules (March 2015), published by Quebec’s Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail (IRSST), using the applicable TWA set out in Table 1 of this Regulation. 7. Short-term exposures to the designated substance in any 15-minute period are determined from a single sample or from a time-weighted average of sequential samples taken during that period. O. Reg. 189/19, s. 14. Part II   coke oven emissions control program – additional elements A.  Engineering Controls 1.  Charging 1. The charging operation shall be conducted in one of the following ways: 1. Stage charging. 2. Sequential charging. 3. Pipeline charging of preheated coal. 4.

During the charging operation, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Inspection and cleaning of goosenecks and standpipes prior to each charge to provide an appropriate open area for the passage of gases from the oven to the collecting main. 2. Inspection and, when appropriate in the circumstances, the removal of roof carbon so as to ensure an adequate free space above the coal charge to allow for the passage of gases to the off-take system. 3. Routine inspection of the steam aspiration system. 4. Routine inspection of the flushing liquor sprays. 5. Cleaning and sealing of standpipe caps as is appropriate in the circumstances. 6. Filling of the larry car hoppers with an appropriate quantity of coal. 7. Alignment of the larry car at the oven so that the drop sleeves fit tightly over the charging holes. 8. Charging of the coal into the oven using the proper sequence for the type of charging operation utilized. 9. The aspiration system to be turned off only when the charging holes have been closed. 2.  Coking 1. During the coking operation, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Repair, replacement or adjustment of oven doors and chuck doors, as well as maintenance of door jambs, as is appropriate in the circumstances, to provide a gas tight fit. 2. Clean oven doors, chuck doors and door jambs between each coking cycle to provide a gas tight fit. 3. An inspection system and a corrective action program to control door and top side emissions. 3.  Pushing 1. During the pushing operation, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Coke spillage to be cleaned up after each push. 2. Coal spillage on the bench to be collected in the bin on the pusher machine. 3. Coal charge to be heated as uniformly as possible for the set time period before pushing. 4. Heating maintenance to be performed to provide heating which is as uniform as possible. 4. Maintenance and Repair 1. In order to ensure adequate maintenance and repair, provision shall be made for the following work practices: 1. Regular inspection of all engineering controls which have been installed to decrease coke oven emissions and effective implementation of all necessary repairs thereto. 2. Regular inspection of battery function and prompt and effective implementation of necessary repairs thereto. C.  Hygiene Facilities 1. Provision shall be made for the following hygiene facilities: 1. Positive pressure, temperature controlled, filtered air for the larry car, pusher machine, door machine and quench car cabs. 2.
