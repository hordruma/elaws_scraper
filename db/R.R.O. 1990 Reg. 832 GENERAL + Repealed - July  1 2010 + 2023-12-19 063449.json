R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 832, s. 39 (2). (3) Fire alarm stations shall be installed on every floor in a nursing home, (a) at every stairwell; and (b) at every exit to the outdoors, (i) from a corridor or lobby, and (ii) from a room that has accommodation for more than sixty persons. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 832, s. 39 (3). (4) Despite subsection (3), no manual fire alarm is required to be closer than 9.14 metres to any other manual fire alarm station on the same floor. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 832, s. 39 (4). (5) Heat or smoke actuated fire detection devices shall be installed in every area in a nursing home except washrooms. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 832, s. 39 (5).

(8) Fire alarm sounding devices shall have a sound that is readily distinguishable from the sound produced by any other sounding device used in the nursing home and shall be installed in locations that enable them to be easily heard throughout the nursing home. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 832, s. 39 (8). (9) Two independent sources of electrical power shall be provided for the fire alarm system in a nursing home and each source of electrical power shall be capable of, (a) supplying adequate electrical power to operate the fire alarm system for a period of twenty-four hours under maximum normal operating conditions; and (b) sounding the fire alarm signals throughout the nursing home for a period of five consecutive minutes immediately after the twenty-four-hour period set out in clause (a).
