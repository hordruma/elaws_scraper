The planning, highway designation and majority of property acquisition for the undertaking was completed before the Act came into force. Liaison with other governmental agencies was part of the initial planning process. B. In 1989, the Ministry of Transportation conducted a review of the planning study which evaluated seven alternatives including the upgrading of existing Highway 3 as well as the designated new alignment. Intergovernmental agency liaison and public participation were part of the review process. The results of this review confirmed the environmental and engineering appropriateness of the designated new alignment and was fully supported by the four municipal governments affected by the project. C. Adjacent sections of Highway 3 (New) from Oldcastle to Essex had been constructed prior to the implementation of the Act and the section from Essex to Ruthven was constructed under Exemption Order MTC-33, resulting in this one uncompleted section remaining to be constructed. D. The completion of this last remaining section of Highway 3 between the City of Windsor and the Town of Leamington will allow the full benefit of a fully controlled access freeway to be realized by the people of Ontario and particularly the business, agricultural and commercial elements in the Windsor-Leamington corridor. E. The Corporations of the County of Essex, the Townships of Mersea and Gosfield South and the Town of Leamington have over the last several years made representation to the Minister of Transportation and requested that the Ministry of Transportation proceed with the construction of the Leamington Diversion within the 1989 to 1994 time period. Each of the municipalities have recently passed resolutions requesting that the Ministry proceed with the undertaking as soon as possible. F. High traffic volumes and accident rates on the existing section of Highway 3 between Ruthven and Leamington will be substantially reduced as a result of the undertaking.",
