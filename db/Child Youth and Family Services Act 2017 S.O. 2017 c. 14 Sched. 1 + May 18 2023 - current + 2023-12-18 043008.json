The child has suffered emotional harm, demonstrated by serious, i. anxiety, ii. depression, iii. withdrawal, iv. self-destructive or aggressive behaviour, or v. delayed development, and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the emotional harm suffered by the child results from the actions, failure to act or pattern of neglect on the part of the child’s parent or the person having charge of the child. 7. The child has suffered emotional harm of the kind described in subparagraph 6 i, ii, iii, iv or v and the child’s parent or the person having charge of the child does not provide services or treatment or access to services or treatment, or, where the child is incapable of consenting to treatment under the Health Care Consent Act, 1996, refuses or is unavailable or unable to consent to, treatment to remedy or alleviate the harm. 8.

The child is younger than 12 and has killed or seriously injured another person or caused serious damage to another person’s property, services or treatment are necessary to prevent a recurrence and the child’s parent or the person having charge of the child does not provide services or treatment or access to services or treatment, or, where the child is incapable of consenting to treatment under the Health Care Consent Act, 1996, refuses or is unavailable or unable to consent to treatment. 13.

Criteria for use of a secure de-escalation room (3) A child or young person may be placed in a secure de-escalation room where, (a) in the service provider’s opinion, (i) the child’s or young person’s conduct indicates that the child or young person is likely, in the immediate future, to cause serious property damage or to cause another person serious bodily harm, and (ii) no less restrictive method of restraining the child or young person is practicable; and (b) where the child is younger than 12, a Director gives permission for the child to be placed in a secure de-escalation room because of exceptional circumstances. One-hour limit (4) A child or young person who is placed in a secure de-escalation room shall be released within one hour unless the person in charge of the premises approves the child’s or young person’s longer stay in a secure de-escalation room in writing and records the reasons for not restraining the child or young person by a less restrictive method. Continuous observation (5) Subject to subsection (9), the service provider shall ensure that a child or young person who is placed in a secure de-escalation room is continuously observed by a responsible person. Review (6) Where a child or young person is kept in a secure de-escalation room for more than one hour, the person in charge of the premises shall review the child’s or young person’s placement in a secure de-escalation room at prescribed intervals. Release (7) A child or young person who is placed in a secure de-escalation room shall be released as soon as the person in charge is satisfied that the child or young person is not likely to cause serious property damage or serious bodily harm in the immediate future. Maximum periods (8) Subject to subsection (9), in no event shall a child or young person be kept in a secure de-escalation room for a period or periods that exceed an aggregate of eight hours in a given 24-hour period or an aggregate of 24 hours in a given week.

The young person must be observed every 15 minutes by a responsible person and these observations must be recorded in the young person’s case record. 2. The service provider must determine whether, given the needs of the young person, the young person should be observed at regular intervals that are more frequent than every 15 minutes, and, if that determination is made, the young person must be observed by a responsible person at the more frequent intervals determined by the service provider and these observations must be recorded in the young person’s case record. 3. The young person must not be kept in a secure de-escalation room for a continuous period in excess of 24 hours or for a period or periods that exceed an aggregate of 24 hours in a seven-day period. 4.

Time and manner for entry (5) The Commissioner shall exercise the power to enter premises under this section only during reasonable hours for the premises and only in such a manner so as not to interfere with services that are being provided to any person on the premises at the time of entry.

Inspection of record without consent (13) Despite subsections (2) and (12), the Commissioner shall not inspect a record of, require evidence of, or inquire into, personal information without the consent of the individual to whom it relates, unless, (a) the Commissioner first determines that it is reasonably necessary to do so, subject to any conditions or restrictions that the Commissioner specifies, which shall include a time limitation, in order to carry out the review and that the public interest in carrying out the review justifies dispensing with obtaining the individual's consent in the circumstances; and (b) the Commissioner provides a statement to the person who has custody or control of the record to be inspected, or the evidence or information to be inquired into, setting out the Commissioner’s determination under clause (a) together with brief written reasons and any restrictions and conditions that the Commissioner has specified. Limitation on delegation (14) Despite subsection 327 (1), the power to make a determination under clause (13) (a) and to approve the brief written reasons under clause (13) (b) may not be delegated except to an Assistant Commissioner.
