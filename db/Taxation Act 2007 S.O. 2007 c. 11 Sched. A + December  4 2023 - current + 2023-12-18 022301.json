A trust is not entitled to a tax credit under this subdivision for a taxation year other than a tax credit for charitable donations under subsection 9 (21). 2. In calculating the total amount of tax credits that an individual, other than a trust, may deduct under this subdivision, the individual shall deduct the tax credits to which he or she is entitled under section 9 in the same order as the subsections relating to those tax credits are listed in that section. 3. A reference to an individual’s basic personal income tax for a taxation year is deemed to be a reference to the amount that would be the individual’s basic personal income tax for the year if the individual’s Ontario allocation factor were one. 4. A reference in a subsection of section 9 to a tax credit under another subsection of that section is deemed to be a reference to that other tax credit as it would be determined before the application of section 10. 5. No pension tax credit under subsection 9 (10) or adoption expense tax credit under subsection 9 (11) may be deducted for a taxation year by an individual described in paragraph 3 of subsection 4 (1). 6. Subsections 118 (4), (5) and (6), 118.01 (3) and 118.3 (3) of the Federal Act apply for the purposes of section 9. 7. An individual who becomes bankrupt in a calendar year is entitled to deduct only the amounts described in the following subparagraphs in computing his or her tax payable under this Division for each taxation year that ends in the calendar year: i. the portions of any tax credits the individual would otherwise be entitled to deduct under subsections 9 (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (6.1), (7), (7.1), (8), (12), (13), (17) and (18) for the taxation year that can reasonably be considered applicable to the taxation year, and ii. any tax credits the individual would otherwise be entitled to deduct under subsections 9 (9), (10), (11), (15), (16), (20), (21) and (22) for the taxation year that can reasonably be considered wholly applicable to the taxation year. 8. If paragraph 7 applies, the sum of all amounts deductible by the individual for all taxation years of the individual ending in a calendar year shall not exceed the total amount that, if the individual had not become bankrupt in the calendar year, would have been deductible for the taxation year that would have otherwise coincided with the calendar year. 9. An individual who is resident in Canada for only part of a taxation year is entitled to deduct only the amounts described in the following subparagraphs in computing his or her tax payable under this Division for the year: i. the portions of any tax credits the individual would otherwise be entitled to deduct under subsections 9 (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (6.1), (7), (7.1), (8), (12), (13), (17) and (18) for the year that can reasonably be considered to apply to any period during the year throughout which the individual was resident in Canada, computed as though that period were the whole taxation year, ii. any tax credits the individual would otherwise be entitled to deduct under subsections 9 (9), (10), (11), (15), (16), (20), (21) and (22) for the year that can reasonably be considered to be wholly applicable to any period in the year throughout which the individual was resident in Canada, computed as though that period were the whole taxation year, and iii. any tax credits the individual would otherwise be entitled to deduct under section 9 for the year, as determined in accordance with paragraph 10.1, that apply to any period in the year throughout which the individual was not resident in Canada, computed as though that non-resident period was the whole taxation year. 10. If paragraph 9 applies, the sum of all amounts deductible by the individual for a taxation year shall not exceed the total amount that would have been deductible for the year if the individual had been resident in Canada throughout the year. 10.1 An individual who is not resident in Canada at any time in a taxation year is entitled to deduct only the amounts described in subsections 9 (9), (12), (14), (15), (21) and (22) in computing his or her tax payable under this Division for the year, unless all or substantially all of the individual’s income for the year is included in computing his or her taxable income earned in Canada for the year. 11. If a separate return of income with respect to an individual is filed under subsection 70 (2), 104 (23) or 150 (4) of the Federal Act, as it applies for the purposes of this Act, for a particular period and another return of income with respect to the individual is filed under this Act for a period ending in the calendar year in which the particular period ends, the sum of all amounts claimed in the returns under subsections 9 (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (18), (20), (21) and (22) shall not exceed the total that could be deducted under those subsections with respect to the individual for a taxation year that coincides with the calendar year. 12. For the purposes of determining the amount of tuition and education tax credits under subsection 9 (19) that may be transferred for a taxation year from a spouse, common-law partner, child or grandchild, the person transferring the tax credits shall designate the amount of tuition and education tax credits to be transferred for the year and the maximum amount that may be deducted under subsection 9 (17) or (18) by an individual for a year in respect of these transferred tax credits must not exceed that amount. 13. For the purposes of determining an individual’s entitlement to a deduction under subsection 9 (14) for a taxation year that ends before January 1, 2018, if the individual was resident in a province other than Ontario on the last day of the preceding taxation year, the amount of the individual’s unused tuition and education tax credits at the end of that preceding year is the amount that would be his or her unused tuition and education tax credits at the end of the preceding year, i. as determined under the comparable provision of a taxing statute of the other province, calculated as if the percentage applied under the relevant provisions of that statute were, at all material times, the lowest tax rate instead of the percentage applied under those provisions, or ii. as determined under section 118.61 of the Federal Act, calculated as if the percentage applied under sections 118.5 and 118.6 of that Act in calculating the individual’s tuition and education tax credits were, at all material times, the lowest tax rate instead of the appropriate percentage, if there is no comparable provision of a taxing statute of the other province. 13.1 Subject to paragraph 13.2, for the purposes of determining an individual’s entitlement to a deduction under subsection 9 (14) for a taxation year that ends after December 31, 2017, if the individual was not resident in Ontario on the last day of the preceding taxation year, the amount of the individual’s unused tuition and education tax credits at the end of that preceding year and at the end of any subsequent taxation year is deemed to be nil. 13.2 For a particular taxation year that begins after December 31, 2017 and ends before January 1, 2022, if the individual satisfies both of the conditions set out in paragraph 13.3, the amount of the individual’s unused tuition and education tax credits at the end of the preceding taxation year in respect of the particular taxation year is the amount that is the lesser of, i. the amount of the individual’s unused tuition and education tax credits at the end of the last taxation year in which the individual was resident in Ontario that is within the period that begins after December 31, 2016 and ends before the last day of the particular taxation year, and ii. the amount that would be the individual’s unused tuition and education tax credits at the end of the preceding taxation year as determined under section 118.61 of the Federal Act, calculated as if the percentage applied under sections 118.5 and 118.6 of that Act in calculating the individual’s tuition and education tax credits were, at all material times, the lowest tax rate instead of the appropriate percentage. 13.3 For the purposes of paragraph 13.2, the conditions for a particular taxation year are as follows: i. The individual was resident in Ontario on December 31, 2017. ii.

Rules for short taxation years and associated corporations (2) The following rules apply in calculating the amount, if any, of a corporation’s surtax for a taxation year under subsection (1): 1. If the taxation year of the corporation is less than 51 weeks, the adjusted taxable income of the corporation for the year is deemed to be the amount of its adjusted taxable income for the year as otherwise determined multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the number of days in the taxation year. 2. If the taxation year of a corporation (called in this subsection the “associated corporation”) that was associated with the corporation during the corporation’s taxation year is less than 51 weeks and is the only taxation year of the associated corporation ending in the corporation’s taxation year, the adjusted taxable income of the associated corporation for that taxation year is deemed to be the amount of its adjusted taxable income for the year as otherwise determined multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the number of days in that taxation year. 3. If the associated corporation has two or more taxation years ending in the corporation’s taxation year, the adjusted taxable income of the associated corporation for its last taxation year ending in the corporation’s taxation year is deemed to be the sum of all amounts, each of which is the adjusted taxable income of the associated corporation for each taxation year ending in the corporation’s taxation year and during which the associated corporation was at any time associated with the corporation multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the total number of days in all of those taxation years.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 32 (2). Small business surtax rate (3) A corporation’s small business surtax rate for a taxation year is 4.25 per cent multiplied by the ratio of the number of days in the taxation year before July 1, 2010 to the total number of days in the taxation year.  2009, c. 34, Sched.

In the formulas described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this subsection, “D” is the greater of, (a) 0.0, and (b) 1– F/$250,000 – H/$50,000, “E” is the consideration for which the investment was issued, “F” is the amount not exceeding $250,000, by which the amount of the total assets or the amount of the gross revenue, measured immediately before the investment is made, whichever is greater, of the qualifying small business corporation or qualifying small business or any associated group of which it is a member is greater than $500,000, “G” is the amount not exceeding $4 million, by which the amount of the total assets or the amount of the gross revenue, measured immediately before the investment is made, whichever is greater, of the qualifying small business corporation or qualifying small business or any associated group of which it is a member is greater than $1 million, “H” is the lesser of, (a) $50,000, and (b) the amount of the consideration in excess of $50,000 for which the investment was issued, and “I” is the lesser of, (a) $750,000, and (b) the amount of the consideration in excess of $250,000 for which the investment was issued. 2. If the investment was issued for consideration of not more than $100,000, the tax credit amount in respect of the investment is the amount calculated using the formula, [(E × 0.20) + (E × 0.55 × D)] × (1 – (G/$4 million)) 3. If the investment was issued for consideration greater than $100,000 but not exceeding $1 million, the tax credit amount in respect of the investment is the amount calculated using the formula, {(E × 0.10) + [E × 0.10 × (1 – (I/$750,000))]} × (1  – (G/$4 million)) 4. If the investment was issued for consideration greater than $1 million, the tax credit amount in respect of the investment is the amount calculated using the following formula: E × 0.10 × (1 – (G/$4 million)) 5. Despite paragraph 2, if the total consideration of all eligible investments issued by a qualifying small business or qualifying small business corporation to a financial institution exceeds $100,000, the tax credit amount in respect of a patient capital investment made by the financial institution in the business or corporation for consideration not exceeding $100,000 is calculated using the formula, E × 0.20 × (1 – (G/$4 million)) 2007, c. 11, Sched.

The Senate, board of governors or other governing body of the eligible educational institution, through its authorized delegate, has given to the Minister of Finance, or to his or her delegate, a document stating that the program or course of study meets the requirements of paragraphs 1 to 5.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (5). Division of work placement into consecutive work placements (6) If a qualifying work placement would otherwise exceed four consecutive months, the following rules apply: 1. The work placement shall be divided into periods of four consecutive months, starting at the beginning of the placement, and each full period of four consecutive months is deemed to be a separate qualifying work placement. 2. If the work placement includes a period of 10 or more consecutive weeks that is not included in a period deemed by paragraph 1 to be a separate qualifying work placement, the period of 10 or more consecutive weeks is deemed to be a separate qualifying work placement. 3. If the work placement includes a period of less than 10 consecutive weeks that is not included in a period deemed by paragraph 1 or 2 to be a separate qualifying work placement, the period of less than 10 consecutive weeks is deemed to form part of the immediately preceding period that is deemed by paragraph 1 to be a separate qualifying work placement.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (6). Work placements with associated corporations (7) Consecutive work placements with two or more associated corporations are deemed to be with only one of the corporations, as designated by the corporations.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (7). Eligible amount (8) A taxpayer’s eligible amount for a taxation year in respect of a qualifying work placement is determined as follows: 1. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year is equal to or greater than $600,000, the eligible amount is the sum of, i. 10 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement before March 27, 2009, and ii. 25 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement after March 26, 2009. 2. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year is not greater than $400,000, the eligible amount is the sum of, i. 15 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement before March 27, 2009, and ii. 30 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement after March 26, 2009. 3. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year is greater than $400,000 but less than $600,000, the eligible amount is calculated using the formula, (10% × E) + (25% × F) + [(5% × G) × (1 – H/$200,000)] in which, “E” is the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement before March 27, 2009, “F” is the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement after March 26, 2009, “G” is the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement, and “H” is the amount by which the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year exceeds $400,000. 2009, c. 18, Sched. 28, s. 9 (3). Same (9) The amount of salaries or wages deemed to have been paid by a corporation in a previous taxation year for the purposes of subsection (8) is the amount that would otherwise be determined for that year if the rules set out in subsections 87 (1.2) and (1.4) of the Federal Act applied.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (9). Eligible expenditures (10) The following amounts paid or payable by a taxpayer in respect of a qualifying work placement are eligible expenditures for a taxation year: 1. An amount paid or payable to a student in the qualifying work placement if, i. the amount is salary or wages paid or payable on account of employment at a permanent establishment of the taxpayer in Ontario, and ii. the amount is required by subdivision a of Division B of Part I of the Federal Act to be included, when paid, in the student’s income from a source that is an office or employment. 2. A fee paid or payable to an employment agency in consideration for the provision of services performed by the student in the qualifying work placement, if the services are performed by the student primarily at a permanent establishment of the taxpayer in Ontario.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (10). Government assistance (11) The total of all eligible expenditures made by a taxpayer in respect of a qualifying work placement is the amount otherwise determined less the amount of all government assistance, if any, that, on the taxpayer’s filing-due date for the year, the taxpayer has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive in respect of the eligible expenditures.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (11). Exceptions (12) Despite subsection (10), an expenditure made by a particular taxpayer in respect of a work placement is not an eligible expenditure for the purposes of this section, (a) to the extent that the amount of the expenditure would not be considered to be reasonable in the circumstances by taxpayers dealing with each other at arm’s length; or (b) if the work placement is with a taxpayer other than the particular taxpayer.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (12). Rules for associated corporations (13) If a qualifying work placement is deemed by subsection (7) to be a work placement with only one of two or more corporations, (a) the corporation designated under that subsection is deemed to have paid all amounts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection (10) that were paid or payable by the corporations, and those amounts are deemed not to have been paid or payable by the other corporations; and (b) the corporation designated under that subsection is deemed to have received or be entitled to receive all government assistance in respect of the work placement that any of the other corporations has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive, and the other corporations are deemed not to have received and not to be entitled to receive that government assistance.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (13). Certification of qualifying work placement (14) Every eligible educational institution in Ontario that has a qualifying co-operative educational program that has qualifying work placements shall certify in a manner or form approved by the Ontario Minister to every taxpayer providing a qualifying work placement that the placement is a qualifying work placement for the purposes of this section, and the certification shall contain the name of the student in the placement and any additional information required by the Ontario Minister.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (14). Minister of Finance’s direction and order (15) If incorrect certifications have been given under subsection (14) or an eligible educational institution has certified a work placement to be a qualifying work placement when it was not, the Minister of Finance may direct the educational institution to cease certifying work placements and may order that all or certain of the work placements of the institution be deemed not to be qualifying work placements for the purposes of this section until the Minister of Finance revokes the direction and order.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (15). Resumption of certification (16) If the Minister of Finance is satisfied that the educational institution will comply with the Minister of Finance’s directions with respect to the accuracy, form and content of certifications to be given under subsection (14), the Minister of Finance, subject to any conditions the Minister of Finance considers reasonable, may revoke the direction and order given under subsection (15), and all work placements that would have otherwise been qualifying work placements while the Minister of Finance’s direction and order were in effect shall, to the extent approved by the Minister of Finance, be considered to be qualifying work placements for the purposes of this section and may be so certified by the educational institution.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (16). Directions under Corporations Tax Act and Income Tax Act (17) Directions and orders of the nature described in subsection (15) that were made under the authority of the Corporations Tax Act or the Income Tax Act shall continue to have the same effect under this Act until revoked by the Minister of Finance in accordance with subsection (16).  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (17). Partnerships (18) The following rules apply if a corporation or individual (in this section referred to as the “partner”) is a member of a partnership and the partnership would qualify for a fiscal period ending in a taxation year of the partner for a co-operative education tax credit if the partnership were a corporation or individual, as the case may be, and the fiscal period were its taxation year: 1. Subject to paragraph 2, the portion of that co-operative education tax credit that may reasonably be considered to be the partner’s share of the tax credit may be included in determining the amount of the partner’s co-operative education tax credit for the partner’s taxation year. 2. If the partner or any other member of the partnership bases a claim in respect of the partnership for the taxation year under subsection (19), no amount in respect of the partnership may be included in determining the amount of the partner’s co-operative education tax credit for the partner’s taxation year otherwise than pursuant to subsection (19).  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (18). Same (19) If it is acceptable to the Ontario Minister, a partner’s share of a partnership’s co-operative education tax credit determined under subsection (18) for a fiscal period shall be equal to such amount as the partner claims not exceeding the amount, if any, by which the amount of that credit exceeds the total of all amounts each of which is claimed under this section, section 43.4 of the Corporations Tax Act or subsection 8 (15) of the Income Tax Act in respect of the amount of that credit by another partner.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (19). Limited partner (20) Despite subsections (18) and (19), a limited partner’s share of a partnership’s tax credit referred to in subsection (18) is deemed to be nil.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (20).

A, s. 96 (12). Designated repayment (13) An amount repaid in a taxation year by a corporation, or deemed under subsection 127 (10.8) of the Federal Act to be repaid in a taxation year by a corporation, is a designated repayment made by the corporation in the year for the purposes of this section to the extent the repayment may reasonably be considered to be a repayment of, (a) government assistance, non-government assistance or a contract payment received, receivable or reasonably expected to be received by the corporation, other than a specified contract payment; (b) an amount that was deducted in determining for the purposes of this section or section 43.3 of the Corporations Tax Act the amount of a qualified expenditure made by the corporation for the taxation year or a previous taxation year; (c) an amount, the deduction of which in determining for the purposes of this section the amount of a qualified expenditure, resulted in a reduction in the amount of a tax credit that would have otherwise been available to the corporation under this section or section 43.3 of the Corporations Tax Act for the taxation year or a previous taxation year; and (d) an amount that under section 127 of the Federal Act reduced the amount of a qualified expenditure made by the corporation for the purposes of the definition of “investment tax credit” in subsection 127 (9) of that Act.  2007, c. 11, Sched.

Same (15) If a corporation files a waiver under subsection (14) in respect of a taxation year, the corporation is deemed never to have been a qualifying corporation under this section for that year in respect of the tax credit or the portion of the tax credit that is waived.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 96 (15). Anti-avoidance (16) A corporation is not entitled to a tax credit under this section for a taxation year if, as a result of a transaction or event, or a series of transactions or events, it is reasonable for the Ontario Minister to believe that one of the principal purposes of the transaction or event, or series of transactions or events, is to render the corporation eligible to claim a tax credit under this section or section 43.3 of the Corporations Tax Act to which it would not have otherwise been entitled, or a tax credit in an amount in excess of the amount to which it would have otherwise been entitled.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 96 (16). Interpretation (17) For the purposes of this section, the following rules apply: 1. The terms “contract payment”, “government assistance” and “non-government assistance” each have the meaning given to those terms in section 127 of the Federal Act, except that a tax credit under this section, section 43.3 or 43.9 of the Corporations Tax Act or section 97 of this Act is deemed not to be government assistance. 2.

Amount of tax credit (2) Subject to subsection (20), the amount of a qualifying corporation’s Ontario business-research institute tax credit for a taxation year is the sum of all amounts, each of which is in respect of an eligible contract and is equal to the amount calculated using the formula, A × B/C in which, “A” is 20 per cent of the total of all qualified expenditures incurred during the year under the contract by the corporation, to the extent that no tax credit has been claimed under this section or section 43.9 of the Corporations Tax Act for a previous taxation year in respect of the qualified expenditures, “B” is the number of days in the year that the corporation is not connected to the eligible research institute that entered into the eligible contract or to any other eligible research institute that carries out the scientific research and experimental development that is to be performed under the contract, and “C” is the number of days in the year. 2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (2). Qualifying corporation (3) A corporation is a qualifying corporation for a taxation year in respect of an eligible contract with an eligible research institute if, (a) the corporation carries on business in Ontario in the year through a permanent establishment in Ontario; and (b) the corporation or a partnership of which it is a member, but not a specified member, entered into the contract with the eligible research institute.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (3). Corporation connected to an eligible research institute (4) For the purposes of this section, a corporation is connected to an eligible research institute at any time during a taxation year of the corporation if at that time, (a) the eligible research institute owned, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, shares of the capital stock of the corporation that, (i) carry more than 10 per cent of the voting rights attached to voting securities, within the meaning of the Securities Act, of the corporation, or (ii) have a fair market value of more than 10 per cent of the fair market value of all of the issued shares of the capital stock of the corporation; (b) the eligible research institute and the corporation were members of the same partnership or did not deal at arm’s length; (c) a partnership of which the eligible research institute is a member owned, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, any of the shares of the corporation; or (d) the corporation and the eligible research institute are connected under the prescribed rules.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (4). Corporate partners (5) If a corporation is a member, other than a specified member, of a partnership at the end of a fiscal period of the partnership in which the partnership would qualify for an Ontario business-research institute tax credit if the partnership were a corporation whose fiscal period was its taxation year, and if the corporation would be a qualifying corporation in respect of the eligible contract if it instead of the partnership had entered into the contract, (a) the portion of the qualified expenditures in respect of which the partnership would calculate the tax credit for the taxation year that may reasonably be considered to be the corporation’s share of the qualified expenditures, (i) is deemed to have been incurred by the corporation and shall be included in determining the total amount of the corporation’s qualified expenditures in respect of the eligible contract for the taxation year in which the partnership’s fiscal period ends, and (ii) may be included in the determination of the amount of the corporation’s Ontario business-research institute tax credit for the taxation year in which the partnership’s fiscal period ends; and (b) the corporation’s share of the qualified expenditures shall be the portion of the qualified expenditures that corresponds to the corporation’s share of the income or loss of the partnership for the fiscal period of the partnership ending in the taxation year and, for the purpose of determining the corporation’s share of the tax credit if the partnership has no income or loss for that fiscal period, the partnership’s income for the fiscal period is deemed to be $1 million.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (5). Eligible contract (6) For the purposes of this section, a contract entered into by a corporation or a partnership with an eligible research institute is an eligible contract if, (a) under the terms of the contract, the eligible research institute agrees to directly perform in Ontario scientific research and experimental development related to a business carried on in Canada by the corporation or partnership, as the case may be, and the corporation or partnership is entitled to exploit the results of the research and development carried out under the agreement; and (b) the contract is entered into after May 6, 1997 or, if the contract was entered into before May 7, 1997, the terms of the contract as they read on May 7, 1997 provide that the eligible research institute will continue to carry out scientific research and experimental development under the contract until a date after May 6, 1999.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (6). Exception, substituted contract (7) Despite subsection (6), a contract entered into after May 6, 1997 that, but for this subsection, would be an eligible contract shall not be an eligible contract for the purposes of this section if the contract may reasonably be considered to require expenditures for scientific research and experimental development that were to be performed under a contract entered into before May 7, 1997 by the corporation or the partnership or by a person related to the corporation or partnership, as the case may be.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (7). Qualified expenditure (8) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an expenditure incurred under an eligible contract with an eligible research institute is a qualified expenditure under the contract to the extent that, (a) the expenditure, when it is made, is, (i) a payment of money made by a qualifying corporation to the eligible research institute under the terms of the contract, or (ii) a prescribed payment; (b) the expenditure is incurred in respect of scientific research and experimental development carried on in Ontario directly by the eligible research institute; and (c) it is an expenditure referred to in subparagraph 37 (1) (a) (i.01), (i.1) or (ii) of the Federal Act that would be a qualified expenditure within the meaning of subsection 127 (9) of that Act, other than an expenditure, (i) that may reasonably be considered to fund the payment of salary or wages to an employee of the eligible research institute who is connected to the corporation making the expenditure, or (ii) that is a prescribed type of expenditure.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (8); 2010, c. 1, Sched. 29, s. 14; 2015, c. 38, Sched. 20, s. 3. Advance ruling required (9) Despite subsection (8), an expenditure that would otherwise be a qualified expenditure of a corporation under this section is deemed not to be a qualified expenditure for the purposes of this section unless, before the corporation or partnership incurs the expenditure, (a) it has applied to the Ontario Minister in the manner and form approved by the Ontario Minister for a ruling with respect to the contract under which the expenditure is to be made, the proposed expenditures to be made under the contract and the arrangements between the parties to the contract and other persons; (b) it has provided all information specified by the Ontario Minister and any other relevant information and documentation that may reasonably be required by the Ontario Minister in connection with the application for the ruling; and (c) the Ontario Minister has given a ruling with respect to the contract, the proposed expenditures and whether the parties to the contract and other persons connected directly or indirectly to the arrangements in respect of the contract are considered to be conducting their business and affairs within the spirit and intent of this section at the time the ruling is given.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (9). Expenditure under more than one contract (10) If an expenditure will be applied under more than one contract, a ruling under subsection (9) must be obtained with respect to each of the contracts.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (10). Expenditure before ruling obtained (11) If a corporation or partnership incurs an expenditure under a contract before the Ontario Minister gives a ruling under subsection (9), and the Ontario Minister subsequently gives a favourable ruling, the expenditure is deemed, for the purposes of subsection (9) but not subsection (2), to have been made after the ruling was given if the corporation or partnership applies to the Ontario Minister for the ruling, (a) within 90 days after the day on which the contract was entered into; or (b) no later than three years after the day on which the contract was entered into, and the Ontario Minister is satisfied that the corporation or partnership was unable to apply for the ruling at an earlier time through no fault of its own for reasons that were beyond its control.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (11). Ontario Minister may dispense with requirement for ruling (12) The Ontario Minister may give a direction that rulings no longer need to be obtained under this section in respect of contracts entered into after the date of the Ontario Minister’s direction, if the Ontario Minister is satisfied that corporations, their officers, directors and shareholders, partnerships and their members and eligible research institutes are conducting their business and affairs in a manner that meets the spirit and intent of this section, and, subject to subsection (13), subsections (9) to (11) will not apply to qualified expenditures made under contracts entered into after the date of the Ontario Minister’s direction.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (12). Ontario Minister may reinstate ruling requirement (13) The Ontario Minister may, at any time after giving a direction under subsection (12), revoke the direction and give a new direction that subsections (9) to (11) shall apply to qualified expenditures made under contracts entered into after the date of the new direction.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (13). Transitional (14) A direction given by the Minister of Finance under subsection 43.9 (13) of the Corporations Tax Act in respect one or more contracts is deemed to have also been given under subsection (12) of this section.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (14). Publication (15) The Ontario Minister shall publicize directions given under subsections (12) and (13), by bulletin or by any other means of communication that, in the opinion of the Ontario Minister, will bring the directions to the attention of those affected.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (15). Reduction in amount of qualified expenditures (16) The total of all qualified expenditures incurred by a corporation under an eligible contract shall be reduced by any contribution that the corporation, any shareholder of the corporation, any partnership of which the corporation is a member, any partner in that partnership or any person not dealing at arm’s length with the corporation or a shareholder of the corporation has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive from, (a) the eligible research institute that entered into the eligible contract; (b) a person who performs scientific research and experimental development that is to be carried out under the contract; or (c) a person who does not deal at arm’s length with either of them.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (16). Exception (17) Despite subsection (16), if under the terms of an eligible contract between an eligible research institute and a corporation or partnership, the eligible research institute directly funds part of the cost of performing the scientific research and experimental development that is to be carried out under the contract, the expenditures made by the institute in performing the scientific research and experimental development shall not be considered to be a contribution if, (a) the financial obligations of the corporation or partnership under the contract are not reduced by the amount of any expenditures made by the eligible research institute; (b) the expenditures made by the eligible research institute are not payments made to or at the direction of the corporation or partnership; and (c) there is an agreement in writing between the eligible research institute and all other persons who are parties to the eligible contract that provides the terms and conditions under which the eligible research institute would be entitled to recover the amount of its expenditures.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (17). Same, transactions in the ordinary course of business (18) Subsection (16) does not apply in respect of the provision of goods and services in the ordinary course of a business carried on by the corporation or partnership if, (a) in the case where the corporation or partnership, or another person who does not deal at arm’s length with the corporation or partnership, acquires the goods or services, the price paid by the corporation, partnership or person for the goods or services is not less than their fair market value; and (b) in the case where the corporation or partnership, or another person who does not deal at arm’s length with the corporation or partnership, is providing the goods or services, (i) the price for the goods or services is not greater than their fair market value, and (ii) the expenditures made to acquire the goods or services do not form part of the expenditures made by the eligible research institute for scientific research and experimental development under the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (18). Repayment of government assistance (19) The total of all qualified expenditures made by a corporation for a taxation year under an eligible contract may include an amount that may reasonably be considered to be a repayment of government assistance made by the corporation during the year, to the extent that the amount, (a) has not been repaid in a previous taxation year; and (b) may reasonably be considered to have reduced the amount of an Ontario business-research institute tax credit that would otherwise have been allowed to the corporation under this section or section 43.9 of the Corporations Tax Act in respect of the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (19). Limit on amount of qualified expenditures (20) The amount of qualified expenditures under an eligible contract with respect to which a corporation may claim a tax credit under this section shall not exceed the amount that may reasonably be considered to be the amount that would have been expended by the corporation if the corporation had carried out the scientific research and experimental development directly in the same circumstances and under the same conditions as the eligible research institute under the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (20). Annual qualified expenditure limit (21) No tax credit may be claimed by a corporation under this section for a taxation year in respect of qualified expenditures that exceed the corporation’s qualified expenditure limit for the year as determined under the prescribed rules.  2007, c. 11, Sched.

Subsidiary wholly-owned corporations (22) An eligible research institute is deemed for the purposes of this section to carry out scientific research and experimental development that is carried out by one of its subsidiary wholly-owned corporations, if the scientific research and experimental development activities are required to be carried out under an eligible contract entered into by the eligible research institute.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (22). Subcontracts (23) If an eligible research institute that entered into an eligible contract with a corporation subsequently enters into a contract with another institute that is an eligible research institute or a specified person and under that second contract the other institute performs part of the scientific research and experimental development that is to be carried out under the eligible contract or the specified person carries out part of the work required to be carried out under the contract, the scientific research and experimental development carried out directly by the other institute or the work carried out by the specified person is deemed to be carried out directly by the eligible research institute under the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (23). When employee connected to corporation (24) For the purposes of this section, where an eligible research institute and a corporation have entered into an eligible contract, an employee of the eligible research institute is connected to the corporation in a taxation year if, at any time in the taxation year of the corporation, (a) the employee or a person who does not deal at arm’s length with the employee owned, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, shares of the capital stock of the corporation that, (i) carry more than 10 per cent of the voting rights attached to voting securities, within the meaning of the Securities Act, of the corporation, or (ii) have a fair market value of more than 10 per cent of the fair market value of all of the issued shares of the capital stock of the corporation; or (b) the employee and the corporation are connected under the prescribed rules.  2007, c. 11, Sched.

A, s. 110 (3). Application of subs. (3) (4) Subsection (3) applies to a transaction if it is reasonable to consider that, (a) the transaction would, if this Act were read without reference to this section, result directly or indirectly in a misuse of the provisions of one or more of, (i) this Act, the Income Tax Act or the Corporations Tax Act, (ii) the regulations made under this Act, the Income Tax Act or the Corporations Tax Act, (iii) a tax treaty, or (iv) any Act or regulation of any jurisdiction that is relevant in computing tax or any other amount payable by or refundable to a person under this Act or in determining any amount that is relevant for the purposes of that computation; or (b) the transaction would result directly or indirectly in an abuse having regard to those provisions, other than this section, read as a whole.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 110 (4). Nature of determination (5) Without restricting the generality of subsection (3) and despite any other Act or regulation of any jurisdiction, in any determination under subsection (3) of the tax consequences of a transaction to a person, (a) any deduction, exemption or exclusion in computing an amount referred to in clause (a) or (b) of the definition of “tax consequences” in subsection (1) may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part; (b) any deduction, exemption or exclusion referred to in clause (a) and any income or loss or other amount used in the determination of any amount payable or refundable under this Act may be allocated to any person; (c) the nature of any payment or other amount may be recharacterized; and (d) the tax effects that would otherwise result from the application of provisions of this Act may be ignored.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 110 (5). Application of subs. (5) (6) Subsection (5) applies to any benefit provided under a tax treaty that applies for the purposes of this Act despite the following: 1. A provision of the tax treaty. 2. A provision of an Act of Canada that gives the force of law to the tax treaty and relates to the application of the tax treaty.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 110 (6). Federal amount deemed to be adjusted for purposes of this Act (7) Despite any other provision of this Act, if an amount under this Act is adjusted under this section by reason of a determination under subsection (3) of the tax consequences of a transaction to a person and the amount would have been, but for that adjustment, an amount determined under the Federal Act, the amount determined under the Federal Act is deemed to have been adjusted to the same extent for the purposes of this Act.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 110 (7). Consequential adjustments (8) If a notice of assessment involving the application of subsection (3) with respect to a transaction has been sent to a person, or a notice of determination under subsection 112 (5) has been sent to the person with respect to the transaction, any other person is entitled, within 180 days after the day of mailing of the notice, to request in writing that the Ontario Minister make an assessment applying subsection (3), or make a determination under subsection 112 (6) with respect to the transaction.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 110 (8).

A, s. 110 (9). Exception (10) Despite any other provision of this Act, the tax consequences to any person following the application of this section shall only be determined through a notice of assessment or through a notice of determination under subsection 112 (5) or (6) involving the application of this section.  2007, c. 11, Sched.

The amount that would be the amount determined under clause (b) or (c) of the definition of “C”, as the case may be, in respect of the corporation for the year if, i. the definition of “manufacturing or processing” in subsection 125.1 (3) of the Federal Act were read without reference to paragraph (h) of that definition (other than for the purpose of the application of subsection (5) and section 5201 of the Federal regulations), and ii. paragraph 5 of subsection (7) applied for the purposes of determining the amount of “C”. 3. The amount determined under clause (d) of the definition of “C” in respect of the corporation for the year.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 33 (2). Adjusted business income (3) The adjusted business income of a corporation for a taxation year is the amount, if any, by which “E” exceeds “F” where, “E” is the sum of all amounts each of which is the adjusted income of the corporation for the year from an active business carried on in Canada, and “F” is the sum of all amounts each of which is the adjusted loss of the corporation for the year from an active business carried on in Canada.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 33 (3). Eligible Canadian profits (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), a corporation’s eligible Canadian profits for a taxation year is the sum of, (a) its Canadian manufacturing and processing profits for the year as determined under subsection 125.1 (3) of the Federal Act; (b) its mining income for the year, to the extent it is not included in the amount referred to in clause (a); and (c) the sum of all amounts each of which is the corporation’s income for the year from farming, fishing or logging in Canada, to the extent it is not included in computing an amount referred to in clause (a) or (b).  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 33 (4). Exception (5) Despite subsection (4), the amount of a corporation’s eligible Canadian profits for a taxation year is equal to its adjusted business income for that year, if, (a) the amount by which the sum of its income from all active businesses for the year exceeds the amount that would otherwise be determined under subsection (4) as its eligible Canadian profits for the year is not greater than 20 per cent of the corporation’s adjusted business income for the year; and (b) the corporation’s adjusted business income for the year does not exceed $250,000.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 33 (5). Ontario adjusted small business income (6) For the purposes of this Part, a corporation’s Ontario adjusted small business income for a taxation year is the amount, if any, calculated using the formula, G – (H/(B × I)) in which, “B”   is the corporation’s Ontario domestic factor for the year, “G” is the amount that would be the corporation’s Ontario small business income for the year if its Ontario domestic factor for the year were one, “H”   is the amount, if any, of the corporation’s surtax payable for the year under section 32, and “I” is the corporation’s small business deduction rate for the year. 2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 33 (6). Interpretation (7) The following rules apply for the purposes of this section: 1. A corporation’s income for a taxation year from farming, fishing, industrial mining operations or logging in Canada is determined in accordance with sections 5200, 5202 and 5204 of the Federal regulations as if, i. the references in those sections to “manufacturing or processing” were references to “farming”, “fishing”, “industrial mining operations” or “logging”, as the case may be, ii. qualified activities referred to in those sections were those activities related to the earning of income from farming, fishing, industrial mining operations or logging in Canada, as the case may be, iii. the definition of “industrial mining operations” that applies for the purposes of this section applied for the purposes of those sections, and iv. in the case of activities related to the earning of income from farming in Canada, the cost of capital of the corporation included the cost of land owned by the corporation and used by it in its farming business in Canada and the annual rental cost incurred by the corporation for land leased by it and used by it in its farming business in Canada. 2. A corporation’s mining income for a taxation year is the sum of, i. the amount, if any, by which its mining profits for the year exceed the amount deducted under section 1201 of the Federal regulations in computing the corporation’s income for the year, and ii. its income for the year from industrial mining operations in Canada, other than income included under subparagraph i. 3.
