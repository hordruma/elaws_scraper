O. Reg. 133/01, s. 1. (2) Subsection (1) applies with respect to an arbitration commenced under a regulation made under: 1.

The parties may jointly appoint a single arbitrator on or after the day the arbitrations are consolidated. 2.  If the parties are entitled to appoint an arbitrator jointly but have not done so, the Superior Court of Justice may make the appointment on a partyâs application under section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 1991. 3.  The arbitrator shall make a final award that disposes of the issue within three months after being appointed. 4.  The date by which the arbitrator is required to make an award shall not be extended by a court, despite section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1991.  However, that date may be extended by agreement of the parties. 5.  The final award shall apportion among the parties the prescribed costs with respect to the geographic area or proposed geographic area. 6.  The arbitration shall not deal with the prescribed costs incurred before the designation date. 6.1  An arbitration between Haldimand County and Norfolk County shall not deal with the prescribed costs payable or to be payable under this Regulation by either of them for a period before January 1, 2002. 7.  The final award may be effective with respect to a period or periods before it is made and, in that case, shall provide for a monetary reconciliation among the parties. 8.  A party may appeal the final award to the Superior Court of Justice only on a question of law, with leave, which the court shall grant only if it is satisfied that the conditions in clauses 45 (1) (a) and (b) of the Arbitration Act, 1991 are met.  No appeal lies on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact, despite any agreement by the parties. 9.  The arbitrator shall provide a copy of the final award to the Minister forthwith after it is made. 10.  At any time during the arbitration, the parties may enter into an agreement under section 13.2 that includes an agreement apportioning among the parties that part of the costs of the arbitration attributable to the prescribed costs, in which case that part of the arbitration terminates. 11.  The parties may, at any time, amend that part of the final award concerning the prescribed costs by agreement or replace that part of the award with an agreement under section 13.2. 12.  That part of the final award in the consolidated arbitration attributable to the prescribed costs comes into effect in accordance with subsection 13.5 (3), 13.5.1 (3), 13.6 (2) or 13.7 (4), as the case may be.
