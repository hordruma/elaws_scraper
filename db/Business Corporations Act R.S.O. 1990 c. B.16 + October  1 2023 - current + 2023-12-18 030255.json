R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, s. 190 (2). Information circular (3) The corporation shall send a management information circular to the holders of the affected securities not less than forty days prior to the date of a meeting which shall be called by it to consider that transaction, and the information circular shall contain, in addition to any other required information and subject to any exemption granted under subsection (6), (a)  a summary of the valuation prepared in compliance with subsection (2) and a statement that a holder of an affected security may inspect a copy of the valuation at the registered office of the corporation or may obtain a copy of the valuation upon request and payment of a specified amount sufficient to cover reasonable costs of reproduction and mailing; (b)  a statement of the approval or approvals of holders of affected securities required to be obtained in accordance with this section; (c)  a certificate signed by a senior officer or a director of the corporation certifying that he or she and, to his or her knowledge, the corporation are unaware of any material fact relevant to the valuation prepared in compliance with subsection (2) that was not disclosed to the valuer; and (d)  a statement of the class or classes of affected securities and of the number of securities of each class and, if any securities of any such class are, under paragraph 3 of subsection (4), not to be taken into account in the vote required by subsection (4), a statement of the number thereof and why they are not to be taken into account, but if all or any portion of a class of affected securities is represented by certificates that are not in registered form, it shall be sufficient to make the information circular available to the holders of such affected securities in the manner provided for in the terms of the securities for sending notice to such holders or otherwise in such manner as may be prescribed.  R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, s. 190 (3). Idem (4) A corporation shall not carry out a going private transaction unless, in addition to any other required security holder approval, the transaction is approved by the holders of each class of affected securities by a vote in accordance with the following provisions: 1.  If the consideration to be received by a holder of an affected security of the particular class is, i.  payable wholly or partly other than in cash or a right to receive cash within ninety days after the approval of the going private transaction, or ii.  payable entirely in cash and is less in amount than the per security value or the mid-point of the range of per security values, arrived at by the valuation prepared in compliance with subsection (2), then the approval shall be given by a special resolution. 2.  In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the approval shall be given by an ordinary resolution. 3.  In determining whether the transaction has been approved by the requisite majority, the votes of, i.  securities held by affiliates of the corporation, ii.  securities the beneficial owners of which will, consequent upon the going private transaction, be entitled to a per security consideration greater than that available to other holders of affected securities of the same class, iii.  securities the beneficial owners of which, alone or in concert with others, effectively control the corporation and who, prior to distribution of the information circular, entered into an understanding that they would support the going private transaction, shall be disregarded both in determining the total number of votes cast and in determining the number of votes cast in favour of or against the transaction.  R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, s. 190 (4). Effect of section (5) The rights provided by this section are in addition to any other rights of a holder of affected securities.  R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, s. 190 (5). Powers of Commission (6) Upon an application by an interested person, the Commission may, subject to such terms and conditions as it may impose, exempt any person from any requirement of this section where in its opinion to do so would not be prejudicial to the public interest, and the Commission may publish guidelines as to the manner and circumstances in which it will exercise this discretion.
