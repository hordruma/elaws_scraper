C6.00 Sick leave AND SHORT TERM LEAVE DISABILITY PLAN Sick Leave provisions applicable to the 2022-2023 fiscal year are found in LOU #18. The following language shall apply effective as of the 2023-2024 fiscal year.

A casual employee within the meaning of the local collective agreement, ii. If clause (i) does not apply, an employee who is a casual employee as agreed upon by the board and the bargaining agent, or iii. If clauses (i) and (ii) do not apply, an employee who is not regularly scheduled to work. Notwithstanding the above, an employee working in a Long-Term Supply Assignment shall not be considered a casual employee for purposes of sick leave entitlement under this article while working in the assignment. “Fiscal Year” means September 1 to August 31. “Wages” is defined as the amount of money the employee would have otherwise received over a period of absence, excluding overtime. Sick Leave Plan a) Sick Leave Benefit Plan The Board will provide a Sick Leave Benefit Plan which will provide sick leave days and short-term leave disability coverage to provide protection against loss of income when ill or injured as defined below.  An employee, other than a casual employee as defined above, is eligible for benefits under this article. Sick leave days may be used for reasons of personal illness, personal injury, personal medical appointments, or personal dental emergencies only.  Appointments shall be scheduled outside of working hours, where possible. Employees receiving benefits under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, or under a LTD plan, are not entitled to benefits under a school board’s sick leave and short term leave disability plan for the same condition. b) Sick Leave Days Permanent Employees Subject to paragraphs d), e) and f) below, permanent Employees will be allocated eleven (11) sick leave days payable at one hundred percent (100%) of wages on the first day of each fiscal year. Where an employee exhausts their allocation of eleven (11) sick leave days, and does not qualify or is not approved for the Short Term Leave Disability Plan under (c), below, subsequent absences due only to personal illness or personal injury will be payable at fifty percent (50%) of wages for a maximum of five (5) days per fiscal year. These days will be deducted from the employee’s Short Term Leave Disability Plan allocation under (c), below, and are eligible for top up in accordance with 6.1(k), below. Employees on Long-Term Supply Assignments Subject to paragraph d) below, employees completing a full-year long-term supply assignment will be allocated eleven (11) sick leave days payable at one hundred percent (100%) of wages at the start of the assignment. An employee completing a long-term supply assignment that is less than a full year will be allocated eleven (11) sick leave days payable at one hundred percent (100%) of wages pro-rated to reflect the proportion the long-term supply assignment bears to the length of the regular work year for the position. Where an employee exhausts their allocation of eleven (11) sick leave days, and does not qualify or is not approved for Short Term Leave Disability Plan under (c), below, subsequent absences due only to personal illness or personal injury will be payable at fifty percent (50%) of wages for a maximum of five (5) days per fiscal year. These days will be deducted from the employee’s Short Term Leave Disability Plan allocation under (c), below, and are eligible for top up in accordance with 6.1(k), below. c) Short Term Leave Disability Plan The STLDP plan will only be available for absences for personal illness or personal injury of a minimum duration of five (5) consecutive days, or as otherwise approved by the Board with supporting medical documentation.  Employees can only access the STLDP plan when they have exhausted the sick leave days allocation as per C6 b). Permanent Employees Subject to paragraphs d), e) and f) below, permanent employees will be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term leave disability days at the start of each fiscal year for periods of approved leave due to personal illness or personal injury. Permanent Employees approved for short term leave disability coverage shall receive payment equivalent to ninety percent (90%) of wages. A permanent employee wishing to access short term leave disability payments must apply with supporting medical documentation at the earliest opportunity. Employees on Long-Term Supply Assignments Subject to paragraph d) below, employees completing a full year long-term supply assignment will, for periods of approved leave due to personal illness or personal injury, be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term leave disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of wages at the start of the assignment. An employee completing a long-term supply assignment that is less than a full year will be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term leave disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of wages prorated to reflect the proportion the long term supply assignment bears to the length of the regular work year for the position. An employee wishing to access short term leave disability payments must apply with supporting medical documentation at the earliest opportunity. d) Eligibility and Allocation A sick leave day/short term leave disability day will be allocated and paid in accordance with current local practice. An employee whose first day of employment falls on a day after the first day of the fiscal year shall have their allocation prorated. Any changes to hours of work during a fiscal year shall result in an adjustment to the allocation. Permanent Employees The allocations outlined in paragraphs b) and c) above will be provided on the first day of each fiscal year, subject to the exceptions below: i. Where a Permanent Employee is accessing sick leave and/or the short-term leave disability plan in a fiscal year and the absence continues into the following fiscal year for the same medical condition, the Permanent Employee will continue to access any unused sick leave days or short-term disability days from the previous fiscal year’s allocation. ii. A new allocation will not be provided to the Permanent Employee until s/he has returned to work and completed eleven (11) consecutive working days at their regular working hours. The Permanent Employee’s new sick leave allocation will be eleven (11) sick leave days payable at 100% wages.  The Permanent Employee will also be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term leave disability days based on the provisions outlined in c) above, reduced by any paid sick days already taken in the current fiscal year. iii. If a Permanent Employee is absent on his/her last regularly scheduled work day and the first regularly scheduled work day of the following year for unrelated reasons, the allocation outlined above will be provided on the first day of the fiscal year, provided the employee submits medical documentation to support the absence, in accordance with paragraph (h). Employees on Long-Term Supply Assignments Employees completing long term supply assignments may only access sick leave and short term leave disability in the fiscal year in which the allocation was provided. Any remaining allocation may be used in subsequent long-term supply assignments, provided these occur within the same fiscal year. Employees employed in a long term supply assignment which is less than the ordinary period of employment for the position shall have their sick leave and short term leave disability allocations pro-rated accordingly. Where the length of the long-term supply assignment is not known in advance, a projected length must be determined at the start of the assignment in order for the appropriate allocation of sick leave/short-term leave disability to occur. If a change is made to the length of the assignment, an adjustment will be made to the allocation and applied retroactively. e) Refresh Provision for Permanent Employees Permanent Employees returning from LTD or WSIB leave to resume their regular working hours must complete eleven (11) consecutive working days at their regular working hours to receive a new allocation of sick/short-term leave disability days. If the Employee has a recurrence of the same illness or injury, s/he is required to apply to reopen the previous LTD or WSIB claim, as applicable. The Local union and Local school board agree to continue to cooperate in the implementation and administration of early intervention and safe return to work processes as a component of the Short-Term Leave and Long-Term Disability Plans. In the event the Employee exhausts his/her sick/short-term leave disability allocation from the previous year and continues to work part-time, their salary will be reduced accordingly and a pro-rated sick/short-term leave disability allocation for the employee’s working portion of the current year will be provided. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave disability allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours. Any changes to hours of work during a fiscal year shall result in an adjustment to the allocation. For the purposes of d) and e) of this article, eleven (11) consecutive working days of employment shall not include a period of leave for a medical appointment, which is related to the illness/injury that had been the reason for the employee’s previous absence, but days worked before and after such leave shall be considered consecutive. It shall be the employee’s obligation to provide medical confirmation that the appointment was related to the illness/injury. f) WSIB & LTD An Employee who is receiving benefits under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, or under an LTD plan, is not entitled to benefits under a school board’s sick leave and short term leave disability plan for the same condition unless the employee is on a graduated return to work program then WSIB/LTD remains the first payer. For clarity, where an employee is receiving partial benefits under WSIB/LTD, they may be entitled to receive benefits under the sick leave plan, subject to the circumstances of the specific situation. During the interim period from the date of the injury/incident or illness to the date of the approval by the WSIB/LTD of the claim, the employee may access sick leave and short term leave and disability coverage. A reconciliation of sick leave deductions made and payments provided, will be undertaken by the school board once the WSIB/LTD has adjudicated and approved the claim. In the event that the WSIB/LTD does not approve the claim, the school board shall deal with the absence consistent with the terms of the sick leave and short term leave disability plans. g) Graduated Return to Work Where an Employee is not receiving benefits from another source and is working less than his/her regular working hours in the course of a graduated return-to-work as the Employee recovers from an illness or injury, the Employee may use any unused sick/short term leave disability allocation remaining, if any, for the portion of the day where the Employee is unable to work due to illness or injury. A partial sick/short term leave disability day will be deducted for an absence of a partial day in the same proportion as the duration of the absence is to an employee’s regular hours. Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from a WSIB/LTD claim, and is working less than his/her regular hours, WSIB and LTD will be used to top up the employee’s wages, as approved and if applicable. Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from an illness which commenced in the previous fiscal year, - and is not receiving benefits from another source; - and is working less than his/her regular hours of work; - and has sick leave days and/or short-term\nleave disability days remaining from the previous year, the employee can access those remaining days to top up their wages proportional to the hours not worked. Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from an illness which commenced in the previous fiscal year, - and is not receiving benefits from another source, - and is working less than his/her regular hours of work, - and has no sick leave days and/ or short-term disability days remaining from the previous year, the employee will receive 11 days of sick leave paid at 100% of wages prorated to the new reduced working hours. When the employee’s hours of work increase during the graduated return to work, the employee’s sick leave will be adjusted in accordance with the new schedule. In accordance with paragraph c), the Employee will also be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term leave disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of regular salary proportional to the hours scheduled to work under the graduated return to work. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours. h) Proof of Illness Sick Leave Days A Board may request medical confirmation of illness or injury and any restrictions or limitations any Employee may have, confirming the dates of absence and the reason thereof (omitting a diagnosis). Medical confirmation is to be provided by the Employee for absences of five (5) consecutive working days or longer. The medical confirmation may be required to be provided on the form contained in Appendix C. Short-Term Leave Disability Days In order to access short-term leave disability, medical confirmation shall be provided on the form attached as Appendix C. Where an Employee does not provide satisfactory medical confirmation as requested or required, or otherwise declines to participate and/or cooperate in the administration of the Sick Leave Plan or Short Term Leave Disability Plan, access to compensation may be suspended or denied. Before access to compensation is denied, discussion will occur between the union and the school board. Compensation will not be denied for the sole reason that the medical practitioner refuses to provide the required medical information. A school board may require an independent medical examination to be completed by a medical practitioner qualified in respect of the illness or injury of the Board’s choice at the Board’s expense. In cases where the Employee’s failure to cooperate is the result of a medical condition, the Board shall consider those extenuating circumstances in arriving at a decision. i) Notification of Sick Leave Days The Board shall notify employees and the Bargaining Unit, when they have exhausted their 11-day allocation of sick leave at one hundred percent (100%) of salary. j) Pension Contributions While on Short Term Disability Contributions for OMERS Plan Members: When an employee/plan member is on short-term leave disability and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OMERS contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay. Contributions for OTPP Plan Members: i. When an employee/plan member is on short-term leave disability and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OTPP contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay. ii. If the plan employee/plan member exceeds the maximum allowable paid sick leave before qualifying for Long-Term Disability (LTD)/Long Term Income Protection (LTIP), pension contributions will cease. The employee/plan member is entitled to complete a purchase of credited service, subject to existing plan provisions for periods of absence due to illness between contributions ceasing under a paid short-term sick leave provision and qualification for Long-Term Disability (LTD)/Long-Term Income Protection (LTIP) when employee contributions are waived. If an employee/plan member is not approved for LTD/LTIP, such absence shall be subject to existing plan provisions. k) Top-up Provisions Employees accessing the five days paid at 50% as set out in paragraph 6.1(b) or short-term leave disability days as set out in paragraph 6.1(c) will have access to any unused sick leave days from their last fiscal year worked for the purpose of topping up wages to one hundred percent (100%). This top-up is calculated as follows: The allocation of sick leave days in their last year worked less the number of sick leave days used. Each top-up from 90% to 100% or from 50% to 100% requires the corresponding fraction of a day available for top-up. In addition to the top-up bank, top-up for compassionate reasons may be considered at the discretion of the board on a case by case basis. The top-up will not exceed two (2) days and is dependent on having two (2) unused Short-Term Paid Leave Days/Miscellaneous Personal Leave Days in the current year. These days can be used to top-up the salary of the five days paid at 50% as set out in paragraph 6.1(b) or short term leave disability days as set out in paragraph 6.1(c). When employees use any part of a short-term leave disability day, they may access their top up bank to top up their salary to 100%. l) Sick Leave to Establish EI Maternity Benefits If the Employee will be able to establish a new EI Maternity Benefit claim in the six weeks immediately following the birth of her child through access to sick leave days at 100% of her regular salary, she shall be eligible for up to six weeks leave at 100% of her regular salary without deduction from the sick days or short-term disability leave days (remainder of six weeks topped-up as SEB). c7.00 Central labour relations committee C7.1 Preamble The Council of Trustees’ Associations (CTA) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) agree to establish a joint Central Labour Relations Committee (Committee) to promote and facilitate communication between rounds of bargaining on issues of joint interest.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1 BETWEEN The Canadian Union of Public Employees   (Hereinafter ‘CUPE’) AND The Council of Trustees’ Associations   (Hereinafter the ‘CTA/CAE’) Re: Status Quo Central Items All provisions of the central terms that have not been amended remain status quo.  In addition, the following central issues have been addressed at the central table and the language relating to these provisions shall remain status quo. For further clarity, if language exists in part B, such language as it pertains to the following items is to be retained. The issues listed below shall not be subject to local bargaining or to amendment by the local parties. Issues: - Paid Vacations - OMERS - Work week (excluding scheduling) - Work year (excluding scheduling) - Hours of Work (excluding scheduling) - Preparation Time - Staffing levels (including staffing levels related to permits and leases and replacement staffing) - Staff development as it relates to access to professional and staff developments - Allowances/Premiums (excluding percentage increase) LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #2 BETWEEN The Canadian Union of Public Employees   (Hereinafter ‘CUPE’) AND The Council of Trustees’ Associations   (Hereinafter the ‘CTA/CAE’) Re: Status Quo Central Items and Items Requiring Amendment and Incorporation The parties agree that the following central issues have been addressed at the central table and that the provisions shall remain status quo or are altered as outlined below. The following language must, however, be aligned with current local provisions. The following issues are not subject to local bargaining or amendment by the local parties. Any disputes arising from these provisions may form the subject of a central dispute. PREGNANCY/PARENTAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE/SEB – EI WAITING PERIOD The parties agree that the issue of the statutory amendment to the Employment Insurance Act resulting in a reduction of the employment insurance waiting period has been addressed at the central table and the intent of any existing local collective agreement provisions shall remain status quo. Therefore, where a school board’s local collective agreement language references a two-week waiting period and required payment for the two-week waiting period, the board shall ensure that the funds payable from the board to a permanent employee taking an approved leave of 12 months or greater, shall reflect the full sum that would have been payable prior to the reduction of the waiting period. Provisions with regard to waiting periods and/or payments during such waiting periods shall not be subject to local bargaining or amendment by local parties. However, existing local collective agreement language may need to be revised in order to align with the terms herein and to accord with the relevant statutory change that reduced the waiting period to one week. STATUTORY/PUBLIC HOLIDAYS School boards shall ensure that within their local collective agreement terms, Family Day is included as a statutory/public holiday. WSIB TOP-UP If a class of employee was entitled to receive WSIB top-up on August 31, 2012 deducted from sick leave, the parties who have not yet do so must incorporate those same provisions without deduction from sick leave.  The top-up amount to a maximum of four (4) years and six (6) month shall be included in the 2019-2022 collective agreement. For parties who have yet to incorporate or aligned local language into the 2014-2017 collective agreement, the following shall apply: Common Central Provisions Maternity Benefits/SEB Plan a) A full-time and part-time permanent Employee who is eligible for pregnancy leave pursuant to the Employment Standards Act, shall receive *100% salary through a Supplemental Employment Benefit (SEB) plan for a total of *eight (8) weeks (*or insert local superior provision reflecting status quo) immediately following the birth of her child with no deduction from sick leave or the Short Term Leave Disability Program (STLDP). b) Full-time and part-time permanent Employees not eligible for a SEB plan as a result of failing to qualify for Employment Insurance will be eligible to receive 100% of salary from the employer for a total of eight (8) weeks with no deduction from sick leave or STLDP. c) Where any part of the eight (8) weeks falls during the period of time that is not eligible for pay (i.e. summer, March Break, etc.), the full eight (8) weeks of top up shall continue to be paid. d) Full-time and part-time permanent Employees who require longer than the eight (8) week recuperation period shall have access to sick leave and the STLDP subject to meeting the requirements to provide acceptable medical verification. e) Employees completing a long term supply assignment\nof 6 months or more shall be eligible for the SEB as described herein for a maximum of eight (8) weeks or the remaining number of weeks in their current assignment after the birth of her child, whichever is less. f) Employees not defined above have no entitlement to the benefits outlined in this article. SHORT TERM PAID LEAVES The parties agree that the issue of short term paid leaves has been addressed at the central table and the provisions shall remain status quo to the provisions in current local collective agreements. For clarity, any leave of absence in the 2008-2012 local collective agreement that utilized deduction from sick leave, for reasons other than personal illness shall be granted without loss of salary or deduction from sick leave, to a maximum of 5 days per school year. For further clarity, those boards that had 5 or less shall remain at that level.  Boards that had 5 or more days shall be capped at 5 days.  These days shall not be used for the purpose of sick leave, nor shall they accumulate from year to year. Short term paid leave provisions in the 2008-12 collective agreement that did not utilize deduction from sick leave remain status quo and must be incorporated into the 2014-17 collective agreement. Provisions with regard to short term paid leaves shall not subject to local bargaining or amendment by local parties. However, existing local collective agreement language may need to be revised in order to align with the terms herein. RETIREMENT GRATUITIES The issue of Retirement Gratuities has been addressed at the Central Table and the parties agree that formulae contained in current local collective agreements for calculating Retirement Gratuities shall govern payment of retirement gratuities and be limited in their application to terms outlined in Appendix B - Retirement Gratuities. The following language shall be inserted unaltered as a preamble to Retirement Gratuity language into every collective agreement: “Retirement Gratuities were frozen as of August 31, 2012. Employees are not eligible to receive a sick leave credit gratuity or any non-sick leave credit retirement gratuity (such as, but not limited to, service gratuities or RRSP contributions) after August 31, 2012, except a sick leave credit gratuity that the Employee had accumulated and was eligible to receive as of that day.  The following language applies only to those employees eligible for the gratuity above.” SICK LEAVE TO BRIDGE LONG TERM DISABILITY WAITING PERIOD Boards which have Long Term Disability waiting periods greater than 131 days shall ensure there is language that accords with the following entitlement: An Employee who has applied for long-term disability is eligible for additional short term disability leave days up to the maximum difference between the long-term disability waiting period and 131 days.  The additional days shall be payable at 90% and shall be used only to bridge the employee to the long-term disability waiting period if, under a collective agreement in effect on August 31, 2012, the employee was required to wait more than 131 days before being eligible for benefits under a long-term disability plan and the collective agreement did not allow the employee the option of reducing that waiting period. LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #3 BETWEEN The Canadian Union of Public Employees   (Hereinafter ‘CUPE’) AND The Council of Trustees’ Associations   (Hereinafter the ‘CTA/CAE’) Re: Job Security: Protected Complement The parties acknowledge that education workers contribute in a significant way to student achievement and well-being. 1. Effective as of November 7, 2022, the Board undertakes to maintain its Protected Complement, except in cases of: a. A catastrophic or unforeseeable event or circumstance; b. Declining enrolment; c. Funding reductions directly related to services provided by bargaining unit members; or d. School closure and/or school consolidation. 2. Where complement reductions are required pursuant to 1. above, they shall be achieved as follows: a. In the case of declining enrolment, complement reductions shall occur at a rate not greater than the rate of student loss, and b. In the case of funding reductions, complement reductions shall not exceed the amount of such funding reductions, and c. In the case of school closure and/or school consolidation, complement reductions shall not exceed the number of staff prior to school closure/consolidation at the affected location(s). Local collective agreement language will be respected, regarding notification to the union of complement reduction.  In the case where there is no local language the board will notify the union within twenty (20) working days of determining there is to be a complement reduction. 3. For the purpose of this Letter of Understanding, at any relevant time, the overall protected complement is equal to: a. The FTE number (excluding temporary, casual and/or occasional positions) as of November 7, 2022.  The FTE number is to be agreed to by the parties through consultation at the local level.  Appropriate disclosure will be provided during this consultation. Disputes with regard to the FTE number may be referred to the Central Dispute Resolution Process no later than December 9, 2022; b. Minus any attrition, defined as positions that become vacant and are not replaced, of bargaining unit members which occurs after November 7, 2022.  For clarity, positions may become vacant as a result of resignation, retirement, dismissal, or internal posting/transfer processes. 4. Once the FTE number has been established in accordance with paragraph 3, above, the local parties shall jointly report the number to the Central Labour Relations Committee. 5. Reductions as may be required in 1. above shall only be achieved through lay-off after consultation with the union on alternative measures, which may include: a. priority for available temporary, casual and/or occasional assignments; b. the establishment of a permanent supply pool where feasible; c. the development of a voluntary workforce reduction program (contingent on full provincial government funding). 6. Where local collective agreement language currently exists that provides a superior benefit specifically with regard to protected complement FTE number, that language will prevail. 7. This Letter of Understanding expires on August 30, 2026.

Funds from this PPF shall be allocated to school boards during the 2023-2024 school year, on the basis of joint applications received from school boards and CUPE locals for skilled trades apprenticeships. The purpose of the PPF is to provide on-the-job skilled trades training for CUPE employees as apprentices. Representatives of the central parties and the Crown will review, update, and revise the existing distribution model and application process.

The issue of short term paid leave has been addressed at the central table and will remain status quo with the exception of the following. 2.

Voting in elections as indicated by a self-governing Indigenous authority where the employee’s working hours do not otherwise provide three consecutive hours free from work; and b. Attendance at Indigenous cultural/ceremonial events. 3. For clarity, provisions with regard to the number of days of short term paid leave shall not be subject to local bargaining or amendment by local parties and remain status quo at a maximum of five (5) days per school year. LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #18 BETWEEN The Canadian Union of Public Employees   (Hereinafter ‘CUPE’) AND The Council of Trustees’ Associations   (Hereinafter the ‘CTA/CAE’) AND The Crown RE:  ARTICLE C6 – SICK LEAVE THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE FROM THE SEPTEMBER 1, 2019 – AUGUST 31, 2022 CENTRAL AGREEMENT WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL AUGUST 31, 2023.  THEREAFTER IT WILL BE CONSIDERED A HISTORICAL APPENDIX FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY. C6.00 Sick leave C6.1 Sick Leave/Short Term Leave and Disability Plan Definitions: The definitions below shall be exclusively used for this article. “Full year” refers to the ordinary period of employment for the position. “Permanent Employees” – means all employees who are not casual employees, or employees working in a long-term supply assignment, as defined below. “Long Term Supply Assignment” means, in relation to an employee, i. a long term supply assignment within the meaning of the local collective agreement, or ii. where no such definition exists, a long term supply assignment will be defined as twelve (12) days of continuous employment in one assignment. “Casual Employees” means, i. A casual employee within the meaning of the local collective agreement, ii. If clause (i) does not apply, an employee who is a casual employee as agreed upon by the board and the bargaining agent, or iii. If clauses (i) and (ii) do not apply, an employee who is not regularly scheduled to work. Notwithstanding the above, an employee working in a Long Term Supply Assignment shall not be considered a casual employee for purposes of sick leave entitlement under this article while working in the assignment. “Fiscal Year” means September 1 to August 31. “Wages” is defined as the amount of money the employee would have otherwise received over a period of absence, excluding overtime. a) Sick Leave Benefit Plan The Board will provide a Sick Leave Benefit Plan which will provide sick leave days and short term disability coverage to provide protection against loss of income when ill or injured as defined below.  An employee, other than a casual employee as defined above, is eligible for benefits under this article. Sick leave days may be used for reasons of personal illness, personal injury, personal medical appointments, or personal dental emergencies only. Appointments shall be scheduled outside of working hours, where possible. Employees receiving benefits under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, or under a LTD plan, are not entitled to benefits under a school board’s sick leave and short term disability plan for the same condition. b) Sick Leave Days Payable at 100% Wages Permanent Employees Subject to paragraphs d), e) and f) below, Employees will be allocated eleven (11) sick days payable at one hundred percent (100%) of wages on the first day of each fiscal year, or the first day of employment. Employees on Long Term Supply Assignments Subject to paragraph d) below, Employees completing a, full-year long term supply assignment shall be allocated eleven (11) sick days payable at one hundred percent (100%) of wages at the start of the assignment. An employee completing a long term supply assignment that is less than a full year will be allocated eleven (11) sick days payable at one hundred percent (100%) reduced to reflect the proportion the long term supply assignment bears to the length of the regular work year for the position. c) Short Term Disability Coverage – Days Payable at 90% Wages Permanent Employees Subject to paragraphs d), e) and f) below, permanent Employees will be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term disability days at the start of each fiscal year or the first day of employment. Permanent Employees eligible to access short term disability coverage shall receive payment equivalent to ninety percent (90%) of regular wages. Employees on Long Term Supply Assignments Subject to paragraph d) below, Employees completing a full year long term supply assignment shall be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short term disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of wages at the start of the assignment. An employee completing a long term supply assignment that is less than a full year will be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short term disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of wages reduced to reflect the proportion the long term supply assignment bears to the length of the regular work year for the position. d) Eligibility and Allocation A sick leave day/short term disability leave day will be allocated and paid in accordance with current Local practice. Any changes to hours of work during a fiscal year shall result in an adjustment to the allocation. Permanent Employees The allocations outlined in paragraphs b) and c) above will be provided on the first day of each fiscal year, or the first day of employment, subject to the exceptions below: Where a permanent Employee is accessing sick leave and/or the short-term disability plan in a fiscal year and the absence continues into the following fiscal year for the same medical condition, the permanent Employee will continue to access any unused sick leave days or short-term disability days from the previous fiscal year’s allocation. A new allocation will not be provided to the permanent Employee until s/he has returned to work and completed eleven (11) consecutive working days at their regular working hours. The permanent Employee’s new sick leave allocation will be eleven (11) sick leave days payable at 100% wages.  The permanent Employee will also be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short term disability leave days based on the provisions outlined in c) above reduced by any paid sick days already taken in the current fiscal year. If a permanent Employee is absent on his/her last regularly scheduled work day and the first regularly scheduled work day of the following year for unrelated reasons, the allocation outlined above will be provided on the first day of the fiscal year, provided the employee submits medical documentation to support the absence, in accordance with paragraph (h). Employees on Long Term Supply Assignments Employees completing long term supply assignments may only access sick leave and short term disability leave in the fiscal year in which the allocation was provided. Any remaining allocation may be used in subsequent long term supply assignments, provided these occur within the same fiscal year. Employees employed in a long term supply assignment which is less than the ordinary period of employment for the position shall have their sick leave and short term disability allocations pro-rated accordingly. Where the length of the long term supply assignment is not known in advance, a projected length must be determined at the start of the assignment in order for the appropriate allocation of sick leave/short term disability leave to occur. If a change is made to the length of the assignment, an adjustment will be made to the allocation and applied retroactively. e) Refresh Provision for Permanent Employees Permanent Employees returning from LTD or workplace insurance leave to resume their regular working hours must complete eleven (11) consecutive working days at their regular working hours to receive a new allocation of sick/short-term disability leave. If the Employee has a recurrence of the same illness or injury, s/he is required to apply to reopen the previous LTD or WSIB claim, as applicable. The Local union and Local school board agree to continue to cooperate in the implementation and administration of early intervention and safe return to work processes as a component of the Short Term Leave and Long Term Disability Plans. In the event the Employee exhausts his/her sick/short-term disability leave allocation from the previous year and continues to work part-time, their salary will be reduced accordingly and a pro-rated sick/short-term allocation for the employee’s working portion of the current year will be provided. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours. Any changes to hours of work during a fiscal year shall result in an adjustment to the allocation. For the purposes of d) and e) of this article, eleven (11) consecutive working days of employment shall not include a period of leave for a medical appointment, which is related to the illness/injury that had been the reason for the employee’s previous absence, but days worked before and after such leave shall be considered consecutive. It shall be the employee’s obligation to provide medical confirmation that the appointment was related to the illness/injury. f) WSIB & LTD An Employee who is receiving benefits under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, or under a LTD plan, is not entitled to benefits under a school board’s sick leave and short term disability plan for the same condition unless the employee is on a graduated return to work program then WSIB/LTD remains the first payor. For clarity, where an employee is receiving partial benefits under WSIB/LTD, they may be entitled to receive benefits under the sick leave plan, subject to the circumstances of the specific situation. During the interim period from the date of the injury/incident or illness to the date of the approval by the WSIB/LTD of the claim, the employee may access sick leave and short term leave and disability coverage. A reconciliation of sick leave deductions made and payments provided, will be undertaken by the school board once the WSIB/LTD has adjudicated and approved the claim. In the event that the WSIB/LTD does not approve the claim, the school board shall deal with the absence consistent with the terms of the sick leave and short term leave and disability plans. g) Graduated Return to Work Where an Employee is not receiving benefits from another source and is working less than his/her regular working hours in the course of a graduated return-to-work as the Employee recovers from an illness or injury, the Employee may use any unused sick/short term disability allocation remaining, if any, for the portion of the day where the Employee is unable to work due to illness or injury. A partial sick/short term leave day will be deducted for an absence of a partial day in the same proportion as the duration of the absence is to an employee’s regular hours. Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from a WSIB/LTD claim, and is working less than his/her regular hours, WSIB and LTD will be used to top up the employee’s wages, as approved and if applicable. Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from an illness which commenced in the previous fiscal year, - and is not receiving benefits from another source; - and is working less than his/her regular hours of work; - and has sick leave days and/or short term disability days remaining from the previous year The employee can access those remaining days to top up their wages proportional to the hours not worked. Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from an illness which commenced in the previous fiscal year, - and is not receiving benefits from another source, - and is working less than his/her regular hours of work, - and has no sick leave days and/ or short term disability days remaining from the previous year, the employee will receive 11 days of sick leave paid at 100% of the new reduced working hours. When the employee’s hours of work increase during the graduated return to work, the employee’s sick leave will be adjusted in accordance with the new schedule. In accordance with paragraph c), the Employee will also be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short term disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of regular salary proportional to the hours scheduled to work under the graduated return to work. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours. h) Proof of Illness Sick Leave Days Payable at 100% A Board may request medical confirmation of illness or injury and any restrictions or limitations any Employee may have, confirming the dates of absence and the reason thereof (omitting a diagnosis). Medical confirmation is to be provided by the Employee for absences of five (5) consecutive working days or longer. The medical confirmation may be required to be provided on the form contained in Appendix C. Short Term Disability Leave In order to access short term disability leave medical confirmation may be requested and shall be provided on the form attached as Appendix “C” to this Agreement. In either instance where an Employee does not provide medical confirmation as requested, or otherwise declines to participate and/or cooperate in the administration of the Sick Leave Plan, access to compensation may be suspended or denied. Before access to compensation is denied, discussion will occur between the Union and the school board. Compensation will not be denied for the sole reason that the medical practitioner refuses to provide the required medical information. A school Board may require an independent medical examination to be completed by a medical practitioner qualified in respect of the illness or injury of the Board’s choice at the Board’s expense. In cases where the Employee’s failure to cooperate is the result of a medical condition, the Board shall consider those extenuating circumstances in arriving at a decision. i) Notification of Sick Leave Days The Board shall notify employees and the Bargaining Unit, when they have exhausted their 11 day allocation of sick leave at 100% of salary. j) Pension Contributions While on Short Term Disability Contributions for OMERS Plan Members: When an employee/plan member is on short-term sick leave and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OMERS contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay. Contributions for OTPP Plan Members: iii. When an employee/plan member is on short term sick leave and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OTPP contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay. iv. If the plan employee/plan member exceeds the maximum allowable paid sick leave before qualifying for Long Term Disability (LTD)/Long Term Income Protection (LTIP), pension contributions will cease. The employee/plan member is entitled to complete a purchase of credited service, subject to existing plan provisions for periods of absence due to illness between contributions ceasing under a paid short term sick leave provision and qualification for Long Term Disability (LTD)/Long Term Income Protection (LTIP) when employee contributions are waived. If an employee/plan member is not approved for LTD/LTIP, such absence shall be subject to existing plan provisions. k) Top-up Provisions Employees accessing short term disability leave as set out in paragraph c) will have access to any unused sick leave days from their last fiscal year worked for the purpose of topping up wages to one hundred percent (100%) under the short term disability leave. This top-up is calculated as follows: Eleven (11) days less the number of sick leave days used in the most recent fiscal year worked. Each top-up to 100% from 90 to 100% requires the corresponding fraction of a day available for top-up. In addition to the top-up bank, top-up for compassionate reasons may be considered at the discretion of the board on a case by case basis. The top-up will not exceed two (2) days and is dependent on having two (2) unused Short Term Paid Leave Days/Miscellaneous Personal Leave Days in the current year. These days can be used to top-up salary under the short term disability leave. When employees use any part of a short term disability leave day they may access their top up bank to top up their salary to 100%. l) Sick Leave to Establish EI Maternity Benefits If the Employee will be able to establish a new EI Maternity Benefit claim in the six weeks immediately following the birth of her child through access to sick leave at 100% of her regular salary, she shall be eligible for up to six weeks leave at 100% of her regular salary without deduction from the sick days or short term disability leave days (remainder of six weeks topped-up as SEB). ______________  Français  ",

In accordance with paragraph c), the Employee will also be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short-term leave disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of regular salary proportional to the hours scheduled to work under the graduated return to work. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">  h) Proof of Illness</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Sick Leave Days</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">A Board may request medical confirmation of illness or injury and any restrictions or limitations any Employee may have, confirming the dates of absence and the reason thereof (omitting a diagnosis). Medical confirmation is to be provided by the Employee for absences of five (5) consecutive working days or longer. The medical confirmation may be required to be provided on the form contained in Appendix C. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Short-Term Leave Disability Days </p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">In order to access short-term leave disability, medical confirmation shall be provided on the form attached as Appendix C. </p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">Where an Employee does not provide satisfactory medical confirmation as requested or required, or otherwise declines to participate and/or cooperate in the administration of the Sick Leave Plan or Short Term Leave Disability Plan, access to compensation may be suspended or denied. Before access to compensation is denied, discussion will occur between the union and the school board. Compensation will not be denied for the sole reason that the medical practitioner refuses to provide the required medical information. A school board may require an independent medical examination to be completed by a medical practitioner qualified in respect of the illness or injury of the Board’s choice at the Board’s expense.</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">In cases where the Employee’s failure to cooperate is the result of a medical condition, the Board shall consider those extenuating circumstances in arriving at a decision.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">  i) Notification of Sick Leave Days</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">The Board shall notify employees and the Bargaining Unit, when they have exhausted their 11-day allocation of sick leave at one hundred percent (100%) of salary. </p> <p class=\"paragraph\">  j) Pension Contributions While on Short Term Disability  </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Contributions for OMERS Plan Members:</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">When an employee/plan member is on short-term leave disability and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OMERS contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay.</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Contributions for OTPP Plan Members:</p> <p class=\"subpara\">  i. When an employee/plan member is on short-term leave<b> </b>disability and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OTPP contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay.</p> <p class=\"subpara\">  ii. If the plan employee/plan member exceeds the maximum allowable paid sick leave before qualifying for Long-Term Disability (LTD)/Long Term Income Protection (LTIP), pension contributions will cease. The employee/plan member is entitled to complete a purchase of credited service, subject to existing plan provisions for periods of absence due to illness between contributions ceasing under a paid short-term sick leave provision and qualification for Long-Term Disability (LTD)/Long-Term Income Protection (LTIP) when employee contributions are waived. If an employee/plan member is not approved for LTD/LTIP, such absence shall be subject to existing plan provisions. </p> <p class=\"paragraph\">  k) Top-up Provisions</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">Employees accessing the five days paid at 50% as set out in paragraph 6.1(b) or short-term leave disability days as set out in paragraph 6.1(c) will have access to any unused sick leave days from their last fiscal year worked for the purpose of topping up wages to one hundred percent (100%). \r\n</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">This top-up is calculated as follows:</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">The allocation of sick leave days in their last year worked less the number of sick leave days used. </p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">Each top-up from 90% to 100% or from 50% to 100% requires the corresponding fraction of a day available for top-up. </p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">In addition to the top-up bank, top-up for compassionate reasons may be considered at the discretion of the board on a case by case basis. The top-up will not exceed two (2) days and is dependent on having two (2) unused Short-Term Paid Leave Days/Miscellaneous Personal Leave Days in the current year. These days can be used to top-up the salary of the five days paid at 50% as set out in paragraph 6.1(b) or short term leave disability days as set out in paragraph 6.1(c). </p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">When employees use any part of a short-term leave disability day, they may access their top up bank to top up their salary to 100%.  </p> <p class=\"paragraph\">  l) Sick Leave to Establish EI Maternity Benefits</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">If the Employee will be able to establish a new EI Maternity Benefit claim in the six weeks immediately following the birth of her child through access to sick leave days at 100% of her regular salary, she shall be eligible for up to six weeks leave at 100% of her regular salary without deduction from the sick days or short-term disability leave days (remainder of six weeks topped-up as SEB).</p> <p align=\"left\" class=\"Pheadingx\"><a name=\"BK32\"></a>c7.00 Central labour relations committee  </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  C7.1 Preamble</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">The Council of Trustees’ Associations (CTA) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) agree to establish a joint Central Labour Relations Committee (Committee) to promote and facilitate communication between rounds of bargaining on issues of joint interest. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  C7.2 Membership</p> <p class=\"parawindt2\">The Committee shall include four (4) representatives from CUPE/SCFP and four (4) representatives from the CTA.

If a change is made to the length of the assignment, an adjustment will be made to the allocation and applied retroactively.</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  e) Refresh Provision for Permanent Employees</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Permanent Employees returning from LTD or workplace insurance leave to resume their regular working hours must complete eleven (11) consecutive working days at their regular working hours to receive a new allocation of sick/short-term disability leave. If the Employee has a recurrence of the same illness or injury, s/he is required to apply to reopen the previous LTD or WSIB claim, as applicable. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">The Local union and Local school board agree to continue to cooperate in the implementation and administration of early intervention and safe return to work processes as a component of the Short Term Leave and Long Term Disability Plans. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">In the event the Employee exhausts his/her sick/short-term disability leave allocation from the previous year and continues to work part-time, their salary will be reduced accordingly and a pro-rated sick/short-term allocation for the employee’s working portion of the current year will be provided. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours. Any changes to hours of work during a fiscal year shall result in an adjustment to the allocation. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">For the purposes of d) and e) of this article, eleven (11) consecutive working days of employment shall not include a period of leave for a medical appointment, which is related to the illness/injury that had been the reason for the employee’s previous absence, but days worked before and after such leave shall be considered consecutive. It shall be the employee’s obligation to provide medical confirmation that the appointment was related to the illness/injury.</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  f) WSIB &amp; LTD </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">An Employee who is receiving benefits under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, or under a LTD plan, is not entitled to benefits under a school board’s sick leave and short term disability plan for the same condition unless the employee is on a graduated return to work program then WSIB/LTD remains the first payor. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">For clarity, where an employee is receiving partial benefits under WSIB/LTD, they may be entitled to receive benefits under the sick leave plan, subject to the circumstances of the specific situation. During the interim period from the date of the injury/incident or illness to the date of the approval by the WSIB/LTD of the claim, the employee may access sick leave and short term leave and disability coverage. A reconciliation of sick leave deductions made and payments provided, will be undertaken by the school board once the WSIB/LTD has adjudicated and approved the claim. In the event that the WSIB/LTD does not approve the claim, the school board shall deal with the absence consistent with the terms of the sick leave and short term leave and disability plans. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  g) Graduated Return to Work</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Where an Employee is not receiving benefits from another source and is working less than his/her regular working hours in the course of a graduated return-to-work as the Employee recovers from an illness or injury, the Employee may use any unused sick/short term disability allocation remaining, if any, for the portion of the day where the Employee is unable to work due to illness or injury. A partial sick/short term leave day will be deducted for an absence of a partial day in the same proportion as the duration of the absence is to an employee’s regular hours. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from a WSIB/LTD claim, and is working less than his/her regular hours, WSIB and LTD will be used to top up the employee’s wages, as approved and if applicable.</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from an illness which commenced in the previous fiscal year, </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">  - and is not receiving benefits from another source; </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">  - and is working less than his/her regular hours of work;</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">  - and has sick leave days and/or short term disability days remaining from the previous year</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">The employee can access those remaining days to top up their wages proportional to the hours not worked.</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Where an employee returns on a graduated return to work from an illness which commenced in the previous fiscal year, </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">  - and is not receiving benefits from another source, </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">  - and is working less than his/her regular hours of work, </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">  - and has no sick leave days and/ or short term disability days remaining from the previous year,</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">the employee will receive 11 days of sick leave paid at 100% of the new reduced working hours. When the employee’s hours of work increase during the graduated return to work, the employee’s sick leave will be adjusted in accordance with the new schedule. In accordance with paragraph c), the Employee will also be allocated one hundred and twenty (120) short term disability days payable at ninety percent (90%) of regular salary proportional to the hours scheduled to work under the graduated return to work. The new pro-rated sick/short-term leave allocation may not be used to top-up from part-time to full-time hours.</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  h) Proof of Illness</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Sick Leave Days Payable at 100%</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">A Board may request medical confirmation of illness or injury and any restrictions or limitations any Employee may have, confirming the dates of absence and the reason thereof (omitting a diagnosis). Medical confirmation is to be provided by the Employee for absences of five (5) consecutive working days or longer. The medical confirmation may be required to be provided on the form contained in Appendix C. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Short Term Disability Leave </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">In order to access short term disability leave medical confirmation may be requested and shall be provided on the form attached as Appendix “C” to this Agreement. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">In either instance where an Employee does not provide medical confirmation as requested, or otherwise declines to participate and/or cooperate in the administration of the Sick Leave Plan, access to compensation may be suspended or denied. Before access to compensation is denied, discussion will occur between the Union and the school board. Compensation will not be denied for the sole reason that the medical practitioner refuses to provide the required medical information. A school Board may require an independent medical examination to be completed by a medical practitioner qualified in respect of the illness or injury of the Board’s choice at the Board’s expense.</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">In cases where the Employee’s failure to cooperate is the result of a medical condition, the Board shall consider those extenuating circumstances in arriving at a decision.</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  i) Notification of Sick Leave Days</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">The Board shall notify employees and the Bargaining Unit, when they have exhausted their 11 day allocation of sick leave at 100% of salary. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  j) Pension Contributions While on Short Term Disability</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Contributions for OMERS Plan Members:</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">When an employee/plan member is on short-term sick leave and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OMERS contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay.</p> <p class=\"headnote\">  Contributions for OTPP Plan Members:</p> <p class=\"subsubpara\">  iii. When an employee/plan member is on short term sick leave and receiving less than 100% of regular salary, the Board will continue to deduct and remit OTPP contributions based on 100% of the employee/plan member’s regular pay.</p> <p class=\"subsubpara\">  iv. If the plan employee/plan member exceeds the maximum allowable paid sick leave before qualifying for Long Term Disability (LTD)/Long Term Income Protection (LTIP), pension contributions will cease. The employee/plan member is entitled to complete a purchase of credited service, subject to existing plan provisions for periods of absence due to illness between contributions ceasing under a paid short term sick leave provision and qualification for Long Term Disability (LTD)/Long Term Income Protection (LTIP) when employee contributions are waived. If an employee/plan member is not approved for LTD/LTIP, such absence shall be subject to existing plan provisions. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  k) Top-up Provisions</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Employees accessing short term disability leave as set out in paragraph c) will have access to any unused sick leave days from their last fiscal year worked for the purpose of topping up wages to one hundred percent (100%) under the short term disability leave. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">This top-up is calculated as follows:</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Eleven (11) days less the number of sick leave days used in the most recent fiscal year worked.</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">Each top-up to 100% from 90 to 100% requires the corresponding fraction of a day available for top-up. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">In addition to the top-up bank, top-up for compassionate reasons may be considered at the discretion of the board on a case by case basis. The top-up will not exceed two (2) days and is dependent on having two (2) unused Short Term Paid Leave Days/Miscellaneous Personal Leave Days in the current year. These days can be used to top-up salary under the short term disability leave. </p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">When employees use any part of a short term disability leave day they may access their top up bank to top up their salary to 100%. </p> <p class=\"headnote\">  l) Sick Leave to Establish EI Maternity Benefits</p> <p class=\"parawindt3\">If the Employee will be able to establish a new EI Maternity Benefit claim in the six weeks immediately following the birth of her child through access to sick leave at 100% of her regular salary, she shall be eligible for up to six weeks leave at 100% of her regular salary without deduction from the sick days or short term disability leave days (remainder of six weeks topped-up as SEB).</p> <p class=\"line\">______________</p> <p class=\"line\"> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/22k19\">Français</a></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p>"
