O. Reg. 459/00, Sched. 5. SCHEDULE 6 INDICATORS OF ADVERSE WATER QUALITY Each of the following is an indicator of adverse water quality: 1. Escherichia coli (E. coli) or fecal coliform is detected in any required sample other than a raw water sample. (Corrective action: Increase the chlorine dose and flush the mains to ensure that a total chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/L or a free chlorine residual of 0.2 mg/L is achieved at all points in the affected part(s) of the distribution system. Resample and analyze. Corrective action should begin immediately and continue until E. coli and fecal coliforms are no longer detected in two consecutive sets of samples or as instructed by the local Medical Officer of Health.) 2. Total coliforms detected (but not Escherichia coli or other fecal coliforms) in any required sample other than a raw water sample. (Corrective action: Resample at the same site and analyze. If confirmed to be positive, increase the chlorine dose and flush the mains to ensure a total chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/L or a free chlorine residual of 0.2 mg/L to all points in the affected part(s) of the distribution system. Corrective action outlined should begin immediately and continue until total coliforms are no longer detected in two consecutive sets of samples or as instructed by the local Medical Officer of Health.) 3. Unchlorinated water is directed to the distribution system, where chlorination is used or required. This includes water in the distribution system which has less than 0.05 mg/L of free chlorine residual when tested. (Corrective action: Restore chlorination immediately and follow instructions as directed by the local Medical Officer of Health.) 4. Samples, other than raw water samples, containing more than 500 colonies per mL on a heterotrophic plate count analysis. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult.) 5. Samples, other than raw water samples, containing more than 200 background colonies on a total coliform membrane filter analysis. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult.) 6. Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp. or fecal streptococci (Group D streptococci) are detected in samples, other than raw water samples. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult.) 7. Sodium concentration exceeds 20 mg/L. Notification need not occur more frequently than once in five years. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again. The aesthetic objective for sodium in drinking water is 200 mg/L. The local Medical Officer of Health must be notified when the sodium concentration exceeds 20 mg/L so that this information may be communicated to local physicians for their use with patients on sodium restricted diets.) 8. A pesticide not listed in Table D of Schedule 2 is detected. (Corrective action: Resample, take a corresponding raw water sample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult. Drinking water should be free of pesticides and every effort should be made to prevent pesticides from entering raw water sources. Pesticides may be reported by their most common trade name, a listing of which, called the Compendium of Scheduled Pesticides is accessible on the Internet through the website of the Ministry of the Environment at www.ene.gov.on.ca.)

the following is an indicator of adverse water quality:</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">1.<i> Escherichia coli (E. coli) </i>or fecal coliform is detected in any required sample other than a raw water sample. (Corrective action: Increase the chlorine dose and flush the mains to ensure that a total chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/L or a free chlorine residual of 0.2 mg/L is achieved at all points in the affected part(s) of the distribution system. Resample and analyze. Corrective action should begin immediately and continue until <i>E. coli </i>and fecal coliforms are no longer detected in two consecutive sets of samples or as instructed by the local Medical Officer of Health.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">2. Total coliforms detected (but not <i>Escherichia coli </i>or other fecal coliforms) in any required sample other than a raw water sample. (Corrective action: Resample at the same site and analyze. If confirmed to be positive, increase the chlorine dose and flush the mains to ensure a total chlorine residual of at least 1.0 mg/L or a free chlorine residual of 0.2 mg/L to all points in the affected part(s) of the distribution system. Corrective action outlined should begin immediately and continue until total coliforms are no longer detected in two consecutive sets of samples or as instructed by the local Medical Officer of Health.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">3. Unchlorinated water is directed to the distribution system, where chlorination is used or required. This includes water in the distribution system which has less than 0.05 mg/L of free chlorine residual when tested. (Corrective action: Restore chlorination immediately and follow instructions as directed by the local Medical Officer of Health.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">4. Samples, other than raw water samples, containing more than 500 colonies per mL on a heterotrophic plate count analysis. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">5. Samples, other than raw water samples, containing more than 200 background colonies on a total coliform membrane filter analysis. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">6. Aeromonas spp., <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Clostridium spp</i>. or fecal streptococci (Group D streptococci) are detected in samples, other than raw water samples. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">7. Sodium concentration exceeds 20 mg/L. Notification need not occur more frequently than once in five years. (Corrective action: Resample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again. The aesthetic objective for sodium in drinking water is 200 mg/L. The local Medical Officer of Health must be notified when the sodium concentration exceeds 20 mg/L so that this information may be communicated to local physicians for their use with patients on sodium restricted diets.)</p> <p class=\"paragraph-e\">8. A pesticide not listed in Table D of Schedule 2 is detected. (Corrective action: Resample, take a corresponding raw water sample and analyze. On confirmation, call the local Medical Officer of Health again and consult. Drinking water should be free of pesticides and every effort should be made to prevent pesticides from entering raw water sources. Pesticides may be reported by their most common trade name, a listing of which, called the Compendium of Scheduled Pesticides is accessible on the Internet through the website of the Ministry of the Environment at <!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/. --><a href=\"http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/\">www.ene.gov.on.ca</a>.)</p> <p class=\"tfootnote-e\">O. Reg. 459/00, Sched. 6.</p> <p class=\"Normal\"></p>"
