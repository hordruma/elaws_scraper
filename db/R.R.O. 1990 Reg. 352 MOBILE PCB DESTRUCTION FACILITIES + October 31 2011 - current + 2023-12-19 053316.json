The maximum one-half hour average concentrations of chlorinated dibenzodioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans in air at a point of impingement from a mobile PCB destruction facility waste disposal site shall be such that the following calculation results in a value of A less than or equal to one: (X/(450pg/m3)) + (Y/(450 × 50 pg/m3)) ꞊ A where x = one half hour concentration, in pg/m3, of chlorinated dibenzodioxin determined at a point of impingement, y = one half hour concentration, in pg/m3, of chlorinated  dibenzofuran determined at a point of impingement, and pg/m3 = picograms per cubic metre. 3. The one-half hour average concentrations of PCB, chlorinated dibenzodioxins and di-benzofurans in air at a point of impingement shall be determined by measurement of the air or by calculation in accordance with the Appendix to Regulation 346 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (General — Air Pollution) made under the Act, as that regulation read immediately before it was revoked on November 30, 2005, except, where the calculation is used, the maximum height above grade of the point of emission, for purposes of the calculation, shall be 12.2 metres. 4. For Class 1 systems, the mass air emissions from the system shall be no greater than 0.001 grams PCB per kilogram of the PCB\r\nintroduced into the system. 5. Solid waste that originates from the operation of a mobile PCB destruction facility waste disposal site shall be dealt with as follows: i. Where the waste contains a concentration of fifty milligrams per kilogram or less of PCB, the waste shall be disposed of in a properly certified waste disposal site. ii. Waste that contains a concentration exceeding fifty milligrams per kilogram of PCB\r\nshall not be diluted. iii. Where the waste contains a concentration exceeding fifty milligrams per kilogram of PCB, Regulation 362 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 applies to its storage, transportation and disposal. 6.  PCB\r\nequipment shall not be decontaminated at a mobile PCB\r\ndestruction facility waste disposal site unless the site is subject to an environmental compliance approval that expressly allows the activity. 7. Cooling water, surface drainage water, including contaminated precipitation, and other wastewater that originates from the operation of a mobile PCB\r\ndestruction facility waste disposal site shall be dealt with as follows: i. Where the wastewater contains a concentration of up to five micrograms per litre of PCB, it may be discharged, A. to a municipal sewage treatment plant, 1.  if the site is subject to an environmental compliance approval that expressly allows the activity and specifies the municipal sewage treatment plants that may receive the discharge, or 2.  in accordance with written instructions of the Director, B. except as prohibited in subsection (2), by spraying it on soil, 1.  if the site is subject to an environmental compliance approval that expressly allows the activity, or 2.  in accordance with written instructions of the Director, C. directly or indirectly into water, 1.  if the site is subject to an environmental compliance approval that expressly allows the activity, or 2.  in accordance with written instructions of the Director. ii. Where the wastewater contains a concentration of five micrograms per litre or greater of PCB, it shall be treated, through removal or destruction of the PCB, to reduce the PCB\r\nconcentration to less than five micrograms per litre and discharged as provided in subparagraph i. iii. Wastewater containing tetrachlorinated to octachlorinated dibenzodioxins or tetrachlorinated to octachlorinated dibenzofurans shall not be discharged, directly or indirectly, into water unless the concentration of these materials in the wastewater ultimately discharged to the natural environment is equal to or less than 0.25 nanograms per litre for each congener group of these chemicals based on a one litre sample size. 8. Every person storing PCB waste at a mobile PCB\r\ndestruction facility waste disposal site shall ensure that the PCB waste is in a safe and secure location so as to prevent PCB waste coming into contact with any person and so that all liquid containing PCBs that may escape can be readily recovered and will not discharge, directly or indirectly, into a watercourse or groundwater. 9. All PCB\r\nliquid that is spilled shall be safely and effectively contained forthwith and the liquid and all associated contaminated materials shall be placed in closed containment. 10. Except as provided in subsection (3), each mobile PCB destruction facility waste disposal site shall have an assigned storage area where all PCB wastes awaiting treatment, decontamination or destruction are contained. 11.

R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 352, s. 6 (2).

O. Reg. 233/11, s. 3 (8).
