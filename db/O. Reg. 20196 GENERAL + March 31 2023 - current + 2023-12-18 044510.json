O. Reg. 115/15, s. 1 (5). (3.2) The references to “75 per cent” in subsection (3) shall be read as “85 per cent” where the circumstances described in subsection (2) exist and no agreement exists respecting the payment of a volume discount or other amount by the manufacturer in respect of the original product either, (a)  between the executive officer and the manufacturer of the relevant original product; or (b)  between the government or other appropriate authority in any province or territory outside Ontario but within Canada and the manufacturer of the relevant original product.

O. Reg. 115/15, s. 1 (5). (4.2) The exceptions set out in subsections (4) and (4.1) do not apply where there is evidence satisfactory to the executive officer that there is another product listed, sold or available for sale that is interchangeable with the original product outside Ontario but within Canada, in addition to the two that are or are proposed to be designated as interchangeable with the original product in Ontario and, for greater certainty, in those circumstances, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection (1) apply. O. Reg. 115/15, s. 1 (5). (4.3) For greater certainty, nothing in this section shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the executive officer to maintain an agreement described in subsection 12 (7) or paragraph 7 of subsection 12.1 (1) with the manufacturer of an original product. O. Reg. 115/15, s. 1 (5).

The manufacturer of the product shall give the executive officer notice of any change made to the product, including a formulation change, and of any change in the ownership of the manufacturer. 2.  The product must be authorized for sale under the Food and Drugs Act (Canada). 3.  The manufacturer of the product must continue to be able to supply the product at the drug benefit price in a quantity that is sufficient to meet the demand for the product. 4.  Where the manufacturer was a party to an agreement to which this paragraph, as it read before October 1, 2006, applied, the manufacturer shall continue to be a party to that agreement until it expires according to its terms. 5.  Subject to paragraphs 6.1 to 6.5, if the product has been designated as interchangeable under the Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing Fee Act the drug benefit price of the product may not be more than the price that could be proposed to the executive officer under section 11 if a proposal was being made with respect to the drug product for the first time. 6.  Revoked:  O. Reg. 220/10, s. 4 (2). 6.1  Paragraph 5 does not apply with respect to a product that was designated as interchangeable with an original product on or before March 31, 2013, where there is evidence satisfactory to the executive officer that, i.  the product is the only drug product of its type that is designated as interchangeable with an original drug product, and has been so designated for at least two years, and ii.  removing the product’s listing would result in significant patient safety or access concerns, or significant increased costs to the Government of Ontario. 6.2  Paragraph 5 does not apply with respect to a product that has been designated as interchangeable with an original product where the manufacturer of the interchangeable product has submitted evidence satisfactory to the executive officer of substantial raw material cost increases or substantial direct manufacturing cost increases, and the executive officer is satisfied that the criteria established under section 12.2 have been met establishing that it is in the public interest that the interchangeable product be listed at a higher drug benefit price. 6.3  In the case of a drug product that was designated as interchangeable under the Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing Fee Act before April 1, 2013, the drug benefit price of the product may not be more than the price that could have been proposed to the executive officer under section 11 as it read on March 31, 2013. 6.4  Despite paragraph 6.3, paragraph 5 applies to a drug product that was designated as interchangeable under the Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing Fee Act before April 1, 2013 if, on or after April 1, 2018, i.  another product is designated as interchangeable with the original product, or another product becomes interchangeable with the original product outside Ontario but within Canada, or ii.  another product that was designated as interchangeable with the original product or another product that was interchangeable with the original product outside Ontario but within Canada is removed from the market. 6.5  When applying paragraph 5, the executive officer may adjust the drug benefit price of the original product upon which the drug benefit price of the interchangeable product is based, having regard to the price of the original product in other provinces and territories and to the historical drug benefit price of the original product on the Formulary or a price that was agreed to by the executive officer and the manufacturer under section 15. However, in doing so, the executive officer shall not change the actual drug benefit price of the original product on the Formulary. 6.6  Revoked: O. Reg. 436/19, s. 3 (2). 6.7  Revoked: O.

O. Reg. 115/15, s. 2 (4). (9) The adjustments mentioned in subsection (8) are as follows: 1.  Determine the highest drug benefit price at which the original product was listed. 2.  Commencing in the year in which the original product ceased to be listed or sold in Ontario, add an amount to reflect the average increase in consumer prices shown in Statistics Canada’s Consumer Price Index for Ontario (All Items) for each succeeding year to, i.  a maximum of 10 years, or ii.  a number of years determined by the executive officer that exceeds 10, where the executive officer is satisfied that it is in the public interest to make such a determination.
