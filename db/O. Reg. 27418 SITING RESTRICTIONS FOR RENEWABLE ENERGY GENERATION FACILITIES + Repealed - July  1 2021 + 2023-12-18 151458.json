For a facility described in paragraph 1 of subsection 1 (1) that is not a facility to which a virtual net metering demonstration project prescribed under section 10 of Ontario Regulation 541/05 (Net Metering) made under the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 relates, the facility must be located at least 15 metres away from the boundaries of the property on which it is located. 4.
