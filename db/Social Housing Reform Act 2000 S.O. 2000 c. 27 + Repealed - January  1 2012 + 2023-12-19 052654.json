If a grievance is filed by or on behalf of a transferred employee against the transferor, or a grievance is filed by or on behalf of the transferor, or a proceeding before the Ontario Labour Relations Board is commenced by or on behalf of a transferred employee against the transferor, or a proceeding before the Ontario Labour Relations Board is commenced by or on behalf of the transferor, before the effective date of the transfer, and the grievance or proceeding is not resolved before that date, i. the grievance or proceeding is continued by or against the transferee, ii. all rights, obligations and liabilities of the employer as a result of the grievance or proceeding vest in or bind the transferee and not the transferor, except as otherwise specified by paragraph 5, iii. upon the resolution of the grievance or proceeding, the transferee does not have any obligations to a trade union or to the transferred employees under the Crown Employees Collective Bargaining Act, 1993 or under a collective agreement between the transferor and a trade union, and iv. upon the resolution of all grievances and proceedings under this paragraph, a trade union that had the right under paragraph 10 to continue to represent transferred employees for the purpose of such grievances and proceedings ceases to have any such right. 12. No transferred employee, and no trade union that represents a transferred employee immediately before the effective date of the transfer, has the right on or after the effective date of the transfer to file a grievance under the collective agreement that is in force immediately before the effective date of the transfer with respect to any matter, regardless of whether the matter arose before or arises on or after the effective date of the transfer. 13. Paragraph 12 does not limit the rights or duties of a trade union that acquires bargaining rights in respect of any of the transferred employees on or after the effective date of the transfer, as contemplated by clause (10) (c), to represent its members. 2000, c. 27, s. 52 (9).

Amount of subsidy (2) The amount of the housing provider’s total subsidy for a fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in a service area is determined using the formula, (A + B + C ) – (D + E ) in which, “A” is the amount of the provider’s mortgage subsidy for the fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area; “B” is the amount of the provider’s rent-geared-to-income subsidy for the fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area; “C” is the amount of property taxes payable by the provider for the fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area; “D” is the amount of the provider’s mandatory payment for the fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area; and “E” is the amount equal to 50 per cent of the amount of the provider’s surplus for the fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area, or such lesser amount as the service manager may determine. 2000, c. 27, s. 103 (2). Mortgage subsidy (3) The amount of the housing provider’s mortgage subsidy for a fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area is the amount determined using the following formula: R – S in which, “R” is the total amount of principal and interest payable by the provider for the fiscal year under mortgages guaranteed by the Province of Ontario or the Ontario Mortgage and Housing Corporation in respect of those projects, and “S” is the amount of the provider’s affordable mortgage payment in respect of those projects. 2006, c. 19, Sched. O, s. 5 (5); 2006, c. 32, Sched. E, s. 5 (2). Affordable mortgage payment (4) The amount of the housing provider’s affordable mortgage payment in respect of its housing projects in the service area is the amount determined using the following formula: T – U in which, “T” is the housing provider’s benchmark revenue from those projects, as determined by the Minister under section 104, and “U” is the amount of the housing provider’s benchmark operating costs in respect of those projects, as determined by the Minister under that section. 2006, c. 19, Sched. O, s. 5 (5). Phase-in subsidy reduction (5) If the amount of a housing provider’s subsidy (other than the rent-geared-to-income subsidy) determined under this section is less than the subsidy (other than the rent-geared-to-income subsidy) paid to the provider under an operating agreement that is terminated by this Act, the following rules apply: 1. The provider may request that the service manager negotiate with the provider a schedule for phasing in the reduction in the subsidy over a series of years. 2. If the provider and the service manager are unable to agree on a schedule, the provider may request that the Minister authorize the phase-in of the reduction in the subsidy and set a schedule for phasing in the reduction over a series of years. 3. The Minister’s decision on whether to authorize a phase-in of the reduction in the subsidy and any schedule set by the Minister for phasing in the reduction are binding on the provider and the service manager. 2000, c. 27, s. 103 (5). Rent-geared-to-income subsidy (6) The amount of the housing provider’s rent-geared-to-income subsidy for a fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area is the amount determined using the formula, F – G in which, “F” is the amount that is the lesser of, (a) the total amount of the provider’s indexed market rents for the fiscal year from the rent-geared-to-income units in the provider’s housing projects in the service area, and (b) the total actual market rent for the fiscal year for those units; and “G” is the amount of rental payments payable to the provider for the fiscal year by the households accommodated in those rent-geared-to-income units. 2000, c. 27, s. 103 (6). Indexed market rents (7) The total amount of a housing provider’s indexed market rents for a fiscal year from rent-geared-to-income units in its housing projects in a service area is the amount determined using the following rules: 1. For the first fiscal year for which the housing provider receives a subsidy under this Act, the total amount of its indexed market rents is the total amount of the provider’s benchmark market rents for those units as determined by the Minister under section 104. 2. For each subsequent fiscal year, the total amount of the housing provider’s indexed market rents is the amount determined by multiplying the market rent index prescribed by the Minister that is applicable to those units for the fiscal year by the total amount of the provider’s indexed market rents for the previous fiscal year. 2000, c. 27, s. 103 (7). Mandatory payment (8) The amount, if any, of the provider’s mandatory payment for a fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in the service area is the amount, if any, determined using the formula, H – (H × J/K) in which, “H” is the amount, if any, by which the amount of the provider’s indexed market revenue for the fiscal year in respect of its projects in the service area exceeds the amount of the provider’s benchmark revenue from those projects, as determined by the Minister under section 104; “J” is the amount of the provider’s benchmark operating costs in respect of those projects in the service area as determined by the Minister under section 104; and “K” is the amount of the provider’s benchmark revenue from those projects as determined by the Minister under section 104. 2000, c. 27, s. 103 (8). Indexed market revenue (9) The amount of the provider’s indexed market revenue for a fiscal year in respect of its housing projects in a service area is the amount determined in accordance with the following rules: 1. For the first fiscal year for which the housing provider receives a subsidy under this Act, the amount of its indexed market revenue is the amount of the provider’s benchmark revenue as determined by the Minister under section 104. 2.
