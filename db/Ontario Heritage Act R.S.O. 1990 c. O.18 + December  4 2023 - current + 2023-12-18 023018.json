Dismissal without hearing of appeal (16) Despite the Statutory Powers Procedure Act and subsections (13) and (15), the Tribunal may, on its own motion or on the motion of any party, dismiss all or part of the appeal without holding a hearing on the appeal if, (a)  the Tribunal is of the opinion that, (i)  the reasons set out in the notice of appeal do not disclose any apparent ground upon which the Tribunal could allow all or part of the appeal, or (ii)  the appeal is not made in good faith, is frivolous or vexatious, or is made only for the purpose of delay; (b)  the appellant has not provided written reasons in support of the objection to the by-law; (c)  the appellant has not paid the fee charged by the Tribunal; or (d)  the appellant has not responded to a request by the Tribunal for further information within the time specified by the Tribunal. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 11, s. 7 (6); 2021, c. 4, Sched. 6, s. 74 (2). Representations (17) Before dismissing all or part of an appeal on any of the grounds mentioned in subsection (16), the Tribunal shall, (a)  notify the appellant of the proposed dismissal; and (b)  give the appellant an opportunity to make representations with respect to the proposed dismissal. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 11, s. 7 (6). Coming into force (18) If one or more notices of appeal are given to the clerk within the time period specified in subsection (11), (a)  the by-law comes into force when all of such appeals have been withdrawn or dismissed; (b)  if the by-law is amended by the Tribunal under subclause (15) (b) (ii), the by-law, as amended by the Tribunal, comes into force on the day it is so amended; or (c)  if the by-law is amended by the council pursuant to subclause (15) (b) (iv), the by-law, as amended by the council, comes into force on the day it is so amended. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 11, s. 7 (6). Registration of by-law (19) The clerk of a municipality shall ensure that a copy of a by-law that comes into force under subsection (18) is registered against the properties affected by the by-law in the appropriate land registry office and that a copy of the registered by-law is served on the Trust. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 11, s. 7 (6). Transition (20) If, on the day subsection 2 (8) of Schedule F to the Government Efficiency Act, 2002 comes into force, the clerk of a municipality has given a notice of intention to designate a property as a property of historic or architectural value or interest but the council has not yet passed a by-law so designating the property and has not withdrawn its notice of intention, (a)  this section does not apply to the notice of intention; and (b)  despite its amendment by section 2 of Schedule F to the Government Efficiency Act, 2002, this section, as it read immediately before its amendment, continues to apply to the notice of intention. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 11, s. 7 (6). Same (21) If, on or before the day the Ontario Heritage Amendment Act, 2005 received Royal Assent, the clerk of a municipality had given a notice of intention to designate a property that complied with subsection (4) as it read immediately before that day but, as of that day, the council had not yet passed a by-law designating the property under this section and had not withdrawn the notice, (a)  the notice continues to have been validly given; and (b)  the requirements of subsection (4) or (4.1), as enacted on that day by subsection 17 (2) of the Ontario Heritage Amendment Act, 2005, do not apply to the notice of intention. 2019, c. 9, Sched. 11, s. 7 (6).
