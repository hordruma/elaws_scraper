Amendments (4) If information disclosed in a disclosure statement delivered under this section changes because of an amendment to a credit agreement, the lender shall deliver a supplementary disclosure statement to the borrower within 30 days after the amendment is made setting out the changed information, subject to subsection (5). Exception (5) If an amendment to a credit agreement consists only of a change in the schedule of required payments by the borrower, it is not necessary for the supplementary disclosure statement to disclose any change to the APR or any decrease in the total required payments by the borrower or the total cost of borrowing under the agreement. See: 1999, c. 12, Sched. F, ss. 16, 45 (2).
