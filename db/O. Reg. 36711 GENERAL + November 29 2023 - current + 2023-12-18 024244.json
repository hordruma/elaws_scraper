O. Reg. 241/22, s. 2. (2) The following are, for the purposes of clause 101.2 (1) (a) of the Act, prescribed requirements with which a service agreement must comply: 1. The agreement must state that the service manager and housing provider intend for the housing project to be governed under Part VII.1 of the Act. 2. The agreement must, i. take effect no less than 30 days after the date on which the service manager and housing provider give notice to the Minister under clause 101.2 (1) (b) of the Act, and ii. state that effective date. 3. The agreement must, i. have a term of not less than 10 years from the effective date, ii. state the term of the agreement, and iii. provide that the agreement continues in effect after the end of the term until, A. the agreement is replaced with a new service agreement, or B. the service manager and housing provider enter into an exit agreement and the exit agreement takes effect. 4. The agreement must specify the following: i. The number of units in the housing project, or a target or range of the number of units in the housing project, in respect of which households shall receive rent-geared-to-income assistance. ii. If applicable, the number of units in the housing project, or a target or range of the number of units in the housing project, in respect of which households shall receive an alternate form of assistance referred to in section 20.1. 5. The agreement must provide the following in respect of the units described in subparagraph 4 i: i. The housing provider shall select households to occupy units and receive rent-geared-to-income assistance using the service manager’s selection system under section 47 of the Act, including the priority rules made under clause 47 (2) (b) of the Act. ii. For the purpose of selecting households using the service manager’s selection system under section 47 of the Act, the same rules shall apply as though the housing project were a Part VII Housing Project, as defined in section 73 of the Act. iii. A household shall not be eligible for rent-geared-to-income assistance unless the household meets the eligibility rules made under section 42 of the Act. iv. The amount of geared-to-income rent shall be determined in the manner prescribed under section 50 of the Act. 6 If the housing project includes special needs housing, as defined in section 38 of the Act, the agreement must specify how households will be selected for special needs housing in the housing project. 7. If one or more households occupying units in the housing project are, on the date immediately before the effective date of the agreement, receiving rent-geared-to-income assistance under Part V of the Act, the agreement must provide that such households shall continue to receive rent-geared-to-income assistance in accordance with section 147.1 of this Regulation. 8. Despite paragraph 5, if one or more households occupying units in the housing project are, on the date immediately before the effective date of the agreement, receiving rent-geared-to-income assistance other than under Part V of the Act in the housing project, the agreement must provide that such households shall continue to receive rent-geared-to-income assistance in accordance with their existing rights. 9. The agreement must specify the mandate of the housing provider, if any, to serve a specified population. 10. If the agreement specifies a mandate referred to in paragraph 9, the agreement must state that the mandate shall be treated in the same manner as a mandate under section 76 of the Act for the purpose of selecting households using the service manager’s selection system under section 47 of the Act. 11. The agreement must include a requirement for the service manager to provide funding to the housing provider, in respect of any units in the housing project where the household pays geared-to-income rent, equal to the difference between the geared-to-income rent payable by the household and the rent that would be payable if no rent-geared-to-income assistance was given in respect of the unit. 12. The agreement must include provision for the following: i.

(2) The following apply with respect to the commencement of an arbitration: 1. If the parties have an agreement referred to in clause 111 (a), a party may commence an arbitration if, i. a notice of termination has been given in accordance with the agreement, or ii. the agreement will expire within 12 months. 2. If an arbitration award referred to in clause 111 (b) is in effect, a party may commence a new arbitration if the arbitration award has been in effect for at least two years. 3. A party may commence an arbitration under paragraph 1 or 2 by serving a notice on the other parties. 4. The parties are deemed to have commenced an arbitration on the day that an agreement referred to in clause 111 (a) is terminated or expires unless, i. the parties have entered into another agreement referred to in clause 111 (a), or ii. one of the parties has already commenced an arbitration under paragraph 1.  O. Reg. 367/11, s. 113 (2). (3) An arbitration is governed by the Arbitration Act, 1991, subject to the following rules: 1. The parties may jointly appoint a single arbitrator on or after the day the arbitration is commenced. 2. If the parties are entitled to appoint an arbitrator jointly but have not done so, the Superior Court of Justice may make the appointment on a party’s application under section 10 of the Arbitration Act, 1991. 3. The arbitrator shall make a final award that disposes of the issue within three months after being appointed. 4. The date by which the arbitrator is required to make a final award shall not be extended by a court, despite section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1991.  However, that date may be extended by agreement of the parties. 5. The final award may be effective with respect to a period before it is made but if it does the final award must provide for a monetary reconciliation among the parties with respect to that period. 6. A party may appeal the final award to the Superior Court of Justice only on a question of law, with leave, which the court shall grant only if it is satisfied that the conditions in clauses 45 (1) (a) and (b) of the Arbitration Act, 1991 are met.  No appeal lies on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact, despite any agreement by the parties. 7. At any time during the arbitration, the parties may enter into an agreement referred to in clause 111 (a) that includes an agreement apportioning the costs of the arbitration among the parties, in which case the arbitration terminates. 8. The parties may, at any time, amend the final award by agreement or replace the award with an agreement referred to in clause 111 (a).  O. Reg. 367/11, s. 113 (3). (4) If the arbitration award will be replacing an agreement referred to in clause 111 (a) the following apply in addition to the rules set out in subsection (3): 1. If the agreement is still in effect when the final award is made, the award shall take effect when the agreement expires or is terminated. 2. If the agreement expires or is terminated before the final award is made, the agreement is deemed to continue in effect until the award is made and the award must provide for a monetary reconciliation among the parties with respect to the period during which the agreement is deemed to continue in effect.  O. Reg. 367/11, s. 113 (4). (5) If the arbitration award will be replacing a previous arbitration award referred to in clause 111 (b) the following applies in addition to the rules set out in subsection (3): 1. The final award shall take effect on the later of, i. the day that is three years after the effective date of the previous award, and ii. the day the notice commencing the arbitration was served, if that day was the first day of the month or, if not, the first day of the month after the day the notice was served.  O. Reg. 367/11, s. 113 (5). (6) The following apply if an arbitration referred to in clause 111 (b) and one or more arbitrations described in subsection (7) are commenced and the arbitrations involve the same parties but no arbitrator has yet been appointed: 1. One arbitrator shall be appointed for all the arbitrations. 2. The arbitrations shall be held as one arbitration. 3.
