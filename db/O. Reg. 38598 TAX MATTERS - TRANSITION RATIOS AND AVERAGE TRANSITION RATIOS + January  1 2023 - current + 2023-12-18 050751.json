The total assessment of the properties in a property class for the previous year includes all assessments made for the purposes of taxation for the previous year that are made after the return of the roll for the previous year. 2.  In determining the total assessment of the properties in a property class for the taxation year, a municipality may elect to exclude the assessment of a property in the property class, i.  if the current value of the property, A.  has, before any adjustment under subsection 19.1 (3) of the Assessment Act, increased by 100 per cent or such greater percentage as the municipality elects since 2012, or B.  has decreased by 25 per cent or such greater percentage as the municipality elects since 2012, and ii.  if the municipality also excludes the assessment of the property in determining the total assessment of the properties in the property class for the previous year. 3.

Multiply the unadjusted tax ratio for the property class for the taxation year by the amount of the total assessment of the properties in that property class for the year. 2.  Multiply the unadjusted tax ratio for the property class for the taxation year by the amount of the total assessment of the properties in that property class for the previous year. 3.

For each property class that is not included in the specified residential classes, the commercial classes or the industrial classes, determine the weighted reassessment change for the property class by dividing the amount determined under paragraph 1 for the property class by the amount determined under paragraph 2 for the property class. 7.
