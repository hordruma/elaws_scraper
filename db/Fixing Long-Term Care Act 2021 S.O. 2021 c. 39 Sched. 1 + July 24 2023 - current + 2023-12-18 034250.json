Grounds (2) A licence may be suspended or revoked under this section if, (a) the licensee has not complied with a requirement under this Act; (b) any person has made a false statement in the application for the licence, or the licensee or any person acting on behalf of the licensee has made a false statement in any report, document or other information required to be furnished under this Act or under any other legislation in relation to the long-term care home; (c) the conduct of the licensee, a person with a controlling interest in the licensee or, where the licensee is a corporation, the conduct of the officers or directors, affords reasonable grounds to believe, (i) that the home is not being or will not be operated in accordance with the law and with honesty and integrity, (ii) that the licensee, officers, directors or persons are not competent to operate a home in a responsible manner in accordance with this Act and the regulations or are not in a position to furnish or provide the required services, or (iii) that the home is being operated or will be operated in a manner that is prejudicial to the health, safety or welfare of its residents; (d) a person has acquired control over, or interfered with, the operation of the long-term care home by exercising a security interest contrary to section 110; (e) a person is in a position to acquire or has acquired control over the operation of the long-term care home by exercising a security interest in accordance with section 110, and the conditions provided for in the regulations apply; or (f) a person has gained a controlling interest in the licensee without the approval of the Director, contrary to section 112, or a condition of such an approval has been breached. When order effective, suspension (3) An order suspending a licence takes effect immediately upon the licensee being served with a copy of the order, but nothing in this section impedes the licensee’s ability to appeal the order under section 171 of this Act, subject to section 25 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act if the order is appealed. When order effective, revocation (4) An order revoking a licence takes effect upon the expiry of the period for appealing the order under section 171 of this Act, subject to section 25 of the Statutory Powers Procedure Act if the order is appealed. Supervision (5) If the Director has made an order suspending or revoking a licence, the Director may also make an order providing for the long-term care home to be occupied and operated by a long-term care home supervisor, (a) for a period of time specified in the suspension order, subject to the regulations, if any; or (b) until the revocation of the licence becomes effective and the residents of the home are relocated. May suspend and revoke (6) If the Director has made an order suspending a licence, the suspension order does not preclude the Director from revoking the same licence after it has been suspended, and may be revoked if the Director is satisfied the licensee cannot or will not properly operate the long-term care home. Supervisor, expiry or surrender (7) Where a licence has expired or been surrendered by the licensee, the Director may appoint a long-term care home supervisor to assume control of the home, independent of the licensee. Reasons for supervisor (8) The Director may appoint a long-term care home supervisor under subsection (5) or (7), where, in the Director’s opinion, (a) it would not be safe for residents to close the home immediately; and (b) the licensee is unable or unwilling to safely operate the home in accordance with all applicable requirements, including licence requirements, for the additional period necessary to close the home safely. Who may be supervisor (9) A long-term care home supervisor may be an employee of the Ministry, or an agent or contractor acting under the authority of the Ministry. Provisions re supervisor (10) The following apply with respect to a long-term care home supervisor: 1. The long-term care home supervisor has all of the powers of the licensee to occupy, manage, operate and administer the home, and the licensee does not have those powers and does not have access to the long-term care home while it is under the supervisor’s control. 2. The long-term care home supervisor shall allow the Ministry full control of the home until the suspension is lifted, the licence expires, the licence is revoked or another solution is reached that is acceptable to the Director. 3. The licensee may not surrender its licence without the Director’s prior approval, unless all applicable requirements under this Act and the regulations have been met. 4. The long-term care home supervisor may have any repairs made to the home that the supervisor considers necessary to prevent, eliminate or reduce harm to or an adverse effect upon the health of any person or impairment of the safety of any person. 5. The cost of repairs under paragraph 4 are a debt owed by the licensee to the Crown and may be set off against the compensation mentioned in paragraph 6 and against any other funding that would otherwise be provided to the licensee under this Act or the Connecting Care Act, 2019. 6. The licensee is not entitled to funding under this Act or the Connecting Care Act, 2019 or payment for any service provided at the home, including a payment by a resident for accommodation, while the home is under the control of the long-term care home supervisor, other than reasonable compensation for use of the licensee’s property. 7. Any other amount owed by the licensee to the Crown may be set off against the compensation mentioned in paragraph 6. 8. The Crown and the long-term care home supervisor shall not, by reason of the appointment of the long-term care home supervisor, the occupation or operation of the home by the long-term care home supervisor or the continuation of an employee’s employment under subsection 160 (2), be responsible for a liability or a portion of a liability incurred or attributable to a period before the supervisor began occupying and operating the home. 9. If the Crown or the long-term care home supervisor pays any amount, a portion of which is attributable to anything that arose or occurred before the long-term care home supervisor began occupying and operating the home, the licensee shall owe the Crown a debt equal to that portion. Occupation of premises (11) Without limiting the generality of subsection (10), the long-term care home supervisor, (a) despite sections 25 and 39 of the Expropriations Act, may immediately occupy, operate and manage the long-term care home; and (b) may apply without notice to the Superior Court of Justice for an order directing the sheriff to assist the long-term care home supervisor in occupying the home. Does not apply to approvals (12) This section does not apply to an approval under Part IX.",

Continuation of employment (2) The long-term care home supervisor may continue the employment of some or all of the employees of the licensee at the home. Employees not continued by supervisor (3) The non-continuation of an employee’s employment under subsection (2) does not affect the employment relationship between the employee and the licensee or their respective rights against, and obligations to, each other, including under any contract of employment or collective agreement. Long-term care home supervisor directs continued employees (4) An employee whose employment is continued under subsection (2) remains the employee of the licensee, but during the period during which the long-term care home supervisor occupies and operates the home, the long-term care home supervisor is solely responsible for the direction of the employee and has the rights, obligations and authority that the long-term care home supervisor would have if the long-term care home supervisor were the employer. Certain termination and severance pay (5) The following apply with respect to all employees of the licensee at the home: 1. If the employee’s employment is terminated by the licensee during the period during which the long-term care home supervisor occupies and operates the home, the Crown shall pay the employee any termination pay, severance pay and entitlements owing under subsections 61 (1) and 64 (1) of the Employment Standards Act, 2000 that the licensee fails to pay. 2. The obligation to pay under paragraph 1 is limited to the portion of the pay and entitlements attributable to periods before the long-term care home supervisor began occupying and operating the home. 3. For greater certainty, paragraph 8 of subsection 159 (10) does not apply with respect to any amount the Crown pays under paragraph 1, but paragraph 9 of subsection 159 (10) does apply to such an amount. Other termination pay, etc., for continued employees (6) In addition to any amounts paid under paragraph 1 of subsection (5), the long-term care home supervisor may pay an employee whose employment is continued under subsection (2) any other termination pay or severance pay and entitlements the employee may be entitled to if the long-term care home supervisor lays the employee off or if the long-term care home supervisor ceases to occupy and operate the home and, for greater certainty, paragraph 9 of subsection 159 (10) applies with respect to the portion of such a payment attributable to a period before the long-term care home supervisor began occupying and operating the home. Limit on changes to terms and conditions (7) Changes to terms and conditions of employment or provisions of a collective agreement agreed to by the long-term care home supervisor apply only with respect to the period during which the long-term care home supervisor occupies and operates the home.

Not successor employer (9) The making of an order under subsection 159 (5), the occupation and operation of the home by the long-term care home supervisor or the ceasing of that occupation and operation is not a sale of a business for the purposes of section 9 of the Employment Standards Act, 2000, section 69 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995 or section 13.1 of the Pay Equity Act.
