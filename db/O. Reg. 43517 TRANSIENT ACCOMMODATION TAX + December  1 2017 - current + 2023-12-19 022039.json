(2) For each full or partial fiscal year of the municipality that the tax is in effect, the municipality shall make one or more payments to the eligible tourism entity that received revenue, directly or indirectly, from providers of transient accommodation in the municipality under a destination marketing program that existed immediately before the tax came into effect, the total of which must be at least equal to the amount determined under this section. (3) Any amounts paid to the eligible tourism entity under subsection (2) shall be used by the eligible tourism entity for the exclusive purpose of promoting tourism. (4) The amount referred to in subsection (2) in respect of a fiscal year of the municipality is the lesser of, (a) the total amount of revenue from the tax received by the municipality in respect of the fiscal year; and (b) the amount determined under subsection (5), (6), (8) or (9) for the fiscal year. (5) If, for the first fiscal year of the municipality in which the tax takes effect, the tax is in effect for the entire fiscal year, the amount referred to in subsection (2) in respect of that fiscal year is the amount determined using the formula, A – B in which, “A” is the total amount of revenue that was collected on transient accommodation provided in the municipality under the destination marketing program in respect of the eligible tourism entity’s last fiscal year that ended before the tax came into effect and that was received by the entity under the program in respect of that year, and “B” is any revenue that was collected on transient accommodation provided in the municipality under a destination marketing program at any time when the tax was in effect and that was received by the entity under the program in the first fiscal year of the municipality in which the tax takes effect. (6) If, for the first fiscal year of the municipality in which the tax takes effect, the tax is not in effect for the entire fiscal year, the amount referred to in subsection (2) in respect of that fiscal year is the amount determined under subsection (5), as if the amount determined under the definition of “A” in that subsection were multiplied by the amount determined using the formula, C/D in which, “C” is the number of days that the tax is in effect in the fiscal year, and “D” is the total number of days in the fiscal year. (7) Subsections (8) and (9) apply with respect to fiscal years of the municipality other than the first fiscal year in which the tax takes effect. (8) For a particular fiscal year of the municipality in which the tax is in effect for the entire year, the amount referred to in subsection (2) in respect of that particular fiscal year is the greater of the following amounts: 1. The total amount of revenue that was collected on transient accommodation provided in the municipality under the destination marketing program in respect of the last fiscal year of the eligible tourism entity that ended before the tax came into effect and that was received by the entity under the program in respect of that year, 2. The amount determined by applying the following steps: i. Determine the amount paid by the municipality to the eligible tourism entity under this section in respect of the fiscal year that precedes the particular fiscal year. If the tax was not in effect for the entire fiscal year that preceded the particular fiscal year, the amount referred to in paragraph 1 is deemed to be the amount determined under this subparagraph. ii. Determine the average annual percentage change in Ontario’s total tourism receipts over the 10-year period between the second year immediately preceding the particular fiscal year and the 12th year immediately preceding the particular fiscal year. iii. Multiply the percentage change determined under subparagraph ii by the amount determined under subparagraph i. iv. If the percentage change determined under subparagraph ii is positive, add the amount determined under subparagraph iii to the amount determined under subparagraph i. If the percentage change determined under subparagraph ii is negative, subtract the amount determined under subparagraph iii from the amount determined under subparagraph i. v. From the amount determined under subparagraph iv, subtract the amount of any revenue that was collected on transient accommodation provided in the municipality under the destination marketing program at any time when the tax was in effect and that was received by the eligible tourism entity under the program in the particular fiscal year of the municipality. (9) For a particular fiscal year of the municipality in which the tax is not in effect for the entire year, the amount referred to in subsection (2) in respect of that particular fiscal year is the amount determined under subsection (8), as if subparagraph 2 v of that subsection did not apply, multiplied by the amount determined using the following formula, (E/F) – G in which, “E” is the number of days that the tax is in effect in the particular fiscal year, “F” is the total number of days in the particular fiscal year, and “G” is the amount of any revenue that was collected on transient accommodation provided in the municipality under the destination marketing program at any time when the tax was in effect and that was received by the eligible tourism entity under the program in the particular fiscal year of the municipality. (10) At the municipality’s request, the eligible tourism entity shall give the municipality evidence, to the municipality’s satisfaction, of the amounts of revenue collected and received under a destination marketing program as referred to in the definitions of “A” and “B” in subsection (5), in paragraph 1 and subparagraph 2 v of subsection (8) and in the definition of “G” in subsection (9). (11) The deadline for paying the amount required under subsection (2) in respect of a fiscal year is 60 days after the end of the fiscal year. (12) Despite subsection (11), the municipality is not required to pay an amount to the eligible tourism entity until it has complied with a request from the municipality under subsection (10).",
