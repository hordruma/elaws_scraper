(1) For the purposes of subsection 135.3 (1) of the Act, the standards described in this section must be considered in equalizing assessments within the classes of real property in the region and in computing the factors resulting from the application of the standards. (2) The proportion that the regional and school board taxes levied for 1994 in each class of real property in the region bears to the total regional and school board taxes levied for 1994 in the region must be maintained in such a way that the amount calculated using the formula, the sum of A × B by property class for all municipalities within the region that pay regional and school board taxes, is substantially the same as the amount calculated using the formula, the sum of C × D by property class for all municipalities within the region that pay regional and school board taxes, in which, “A” is the mill rate in each municipality which resulted in the amount of regional and school board taxes levied for 1994 against the total assessment in 1994 of all the properties that comprise the class, “B” is the total assessment in each municipality in 1994 of all the properties that comprise the class, “C” is the adjusted mill rate which would have resulted in the amount of regional and school board taxes levied for 1994 against the total assessment “D”, and “D” is the total assessment in each municipality of all the properties that comprise the class for the 1995 taxation year following the application of the assessment standards described in this section. (3) All real property within a class in the region must, to the extent possible, be assessed at the same proportion of market value in relation to the base year 1992. (4) For the purpose of subsection (3), market value is as determined by the assessment commissioner in whose assessment region the real property is located. (5) The total taxes collected from the taxable real property in the region, including assessments made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act, must not be substantially changed. (6) The proportion of regional and school board taxes paid by each class in the region must not be significantly altered as a result of the application of standards described in this section. (7) Subsection (6) does not apply with respect to changes in assessment relationships that have resulted from an increase in the total assessment of a class because of assessments made under section 33 or 34 of the Assessment Act. (8) The total taxes collected from the taxable real property in the municipality for local purposes must not be substantially changed. O. Reg. 275/95, s. 4.",
