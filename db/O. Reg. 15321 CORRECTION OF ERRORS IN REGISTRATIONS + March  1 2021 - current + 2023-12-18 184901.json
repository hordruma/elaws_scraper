(2) If an applicant applies for the correction of an error in the birth registration of a child, each person who certified the birth of the child under section 9 of the Act shall provide a statutory declaration, in a form approved by the Registrar General, that, (a)  confirms that the person making the declaration is a person who certified the birth; (b)  confirms that an error has been made in the birth registration and confirms that the error is a typographical or similar error described in clause (1) (a) and that the correction of the error does not involve the addition, replacement or removal of a name or a change in the order of names; (c)  describes the changes that are necessary to correct the error in the registration; and (d)  sets out all other information with respect to the error that the Registrar General requires. (3) If a person who certified the birth does not provide the statutory declaration required under subsection (2) due to incapacity, the Registrar General shall require the applicant to, (a)  provide documentary proof that is satisfactory to the Registrar General or other evidence to demonstrate the reason why a person who certified the birth did not provide the statutory declaration required by subsection (2); and (b)  provide a statutory declaration, in a form approved by the Registrar General, stating that a person who certified the birth is incapable. (4) A person may not apply to correct an error under this section if all persons who certified the birth are unable to provide the statutory declaration required by subsection (2) due to incapacity.
