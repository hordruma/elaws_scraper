See: 2006, c. 4, ss. 43 (2), 55 (2).

Every resident has the right to live in a safe and clean environment. 19. Every resident has the right to be given access to protected areas outside the approved charitable home for the aged in order to enjoy outdoor activity, unless the physical setting makes this impossible. 1993, c. 2, s. 2; 1999, c. 6, s. 5 (1); 2004, c. 3, Sched.
