Add 20 to the average number of pupils per grade. ii. Divide 40 by the sum obtained under subparagraph i. iii. Add one to the result obtained under subparagraph ii. 6. For all other small secondary schools of a French-language district school board, the remoteness factor is 1.0. O. Reg. 154/01, s. 28 (8).

The provision of library instruction or guidance to pupils is considered the provision of instruction to pupils for the purposes of paragraphs 1, 3 and 4. 3. If a teacher is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2001 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils of the board and is also assigned, as of that date, under section 17 of Regulation 298 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990, to spend part of his or her time acting as a consultant, co-ordinator or supervisor, the full-time equivalency for the teacher is determined as follows: i.

If a principal or vice-principal is assigned in a regular timetable that is in effect as of October 31, 2001 to spend part of his or her time providing instruction to pupils of the board, the principal or vice-principal is counted as a teacher for the purposes of this section and his or her full-time equivalency as a teacher is determined as follows: i.

O. Reg. 154/01, s. 32 (6). (7) The number of full years of teaching experience of a teacher is deemed to be the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience before the first day of the 2001-2002 school year, rounded to the nearest whole number if the teacher’s number of years of teaching experience is not a whole number and, for this purpose, a number ending in .5 is considered to be nearer to the next whole number.

If a board uses a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that QECO categories system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 3. If a board uses an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a teacher employed by it, that OSSTF certification system is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use a QECO categories system for salary purposes in relation to an elementary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for elementary school teachers in filling out the 2001 Data Form A submitted to the Office of Collective Bargaining Information of the Ministry of Labour is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 5. Subject to paragraph 6, if a board does not use an AEFO certification system, a QECO categories system or an OSSTF certification system for salary purposes in relation to a secondary school teacher employed by it, the classification system used by the board for secondary school teachers in filling out the 2001 Data Form A submitted to the Office of Collective Bargaining Information of the Ministry of Labour is used for that teacher for the purposes of this section. 6. In the circumstances described in paragraph 4 or 5, the board may elect, by written notice to the Minister, to use the AEFO certification system, the QECO categories system referred to by QECO as QECO Programme Level 4 or the 1992 OSSTF certification system, instead of the classification system required under paragraph 4 or 5. 7. The qualification category of a principal or vice-principal is deemed to be A4/Group 4. 8. If the qualification category of a person is changed after October 31, 2001 and the change for salary purposes is retroactive to a day in the period between the first day of the 2001-2002 school year and October 31, 2001, the changed qualification category must be used for the purposes of this section.

(11) The amount of the teacher compensation allocation for a district school board is the total of the elementary school teacher compensation allocation and the secondary school teacher compensation allocation. O. Reg. 154/01, s. 32 (11). (12) The amount of the elementary school teacher compensation allocation for a district school board is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 6, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and .7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or Group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/Group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 6, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in Table 6. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to elementary school pupils. 5.

Multiply the amount determined under paragraph 6 by the 2001-2002 day school average daily enrolment of elementary school pupils of the board. O. Reg. 154/01, s. 32 (12). (13) The amount of the secondary school teacher compensation allocation for a district school board is determined as follows: 1. For each cell in Table 6, determine the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who have the qualification category and the number of full years of teaching experience that correspond with the co-ordinates of the cell. For example, a teacher with a qualification category of D and .7 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell D-1 and a teacher with a qualification category of A2 or Group 2 and 3.2 years of teaching experience is counted for the purposes of cell A2/Group 2-3. 2. For each cell in Table 6, multiply the number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils who are counted for the purposes of the cell by the number set out in that cell in Table 6. 3. Add all the products obtained under paragraph 2 for the board. 4. Divide the sum determined under paragraph 3 by the total number of teachers employed by the board to provide instruction to secondary school pupils. 5.

Reg. 154/01, s. 32 (13). (14) The special assistance amount for a high credit per pupil average is determined as follows: 1. Determine the average number of credits per secondary school pupil of the board for the 2000-2001 school year. 2. If the number determined under paragraph 1 is 7.5 or less but more than 7.2, deduct 7.2 from the number determined under paragraph 1. 3. If the number determined under paragraph 1 is more than 7.5, deduct 7.2 from 7.5. 4. Divide the number obtained under paragraph 2 or 3, as the case may be, by 7.2. 5.
