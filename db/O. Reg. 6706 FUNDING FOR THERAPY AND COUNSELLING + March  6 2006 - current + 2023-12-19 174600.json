O. Reg. 67/06, s. 2 (2). (3) Without limiting the generality of clause (2) (d), the following are examples of the kinds of evidence that may support a reasonable belief that a person, while a patient, was sexually abused by a member: 1.

Evidence of reports made with respect to the member under subsection 85.1 (1) or 85.2 (1) of the Health Professions Procedural Code. 3. Evidence that corroborates the person’s allegations of sexual abuse. O. Reg. 67/06, s. 2 (3).
