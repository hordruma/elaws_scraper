A notice of butternut impact form that a person is required to submit to the Minister through the Registry under paragraph 1 of section 26. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (1). (1.1) A notice form shall include an indication as to whether the person submitting the notice form has elected, in order to meet the requirements for an exemption provided under this Regulation, either, (a)  to pay a species conservation charge to the Species at Risk Conservation Trust and thus be excluded, in accordance with the requirements for the relevant exemption, from some of the conditions otherwise required for the exemption; or (b)  not to pay a species conservation charge to the Species at Risk Conservation Trust and to satisfy all of the conditions that are required for the exemption. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 37 (2). (2) Before submitting a notice form to the Minister, a person shall ensure that, (a)  all mandatory information requested on the form, including the contact information for the person, has been provided; and (b)  the information provided on the form is complete and accurate. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (2). (3) After submitting a notice form to the Minister, the person shall, (a)  promptly upon obtaining from the Ministry confirmation that a notice form submitted through the Registry has been received by the Minister, make a record of the confirmation; (b)  for as long as the activity is being carried out or, in the case of a notice of butternut impact form, for as long as the impactful actions that may impact butternut trees are being carried out, (i)  keep the record of the confirmation and, if applicable, ensure that a copy of the record is kept at the site where, as the case may be, (A)  the activity is being carried out, or (B)  the butternut trees are being killed, harmed or taken, and (ii)  make the record of the confirmation available to the Ministry upon receiving a request for it; and (c)  if there is a change in or error or omission in the administrative information provided in a notice form, update the information on the Registry within 10 business days of the change or becoming aware of the error or omission. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (3). (4) A person who submits a notice form through the Registry shall be deemed not to have done so if the person, (a)  fails to provide all the information required on a notice form; or (b)  provides false or misleading information on a notice form or when updating information on the Registry. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (4). (5) A person who has submitted a notice form to the Minister under this Regulation may submit an amended notice form to the Minister through the Registry in accordance with the following rules, for the purpose of making one or more of the following amendments to the notice form previously registered: 1.  A person who has submitted a notice of activity form may submit an amended notice form to make the following changes to the notice form previously registered, if the amended notice form is submitted before the commencement of the activity described in the previous notice form: i.  A change to the description of the activity and its impacts. ii.  A change to the start date of the activity. 2.  A person who has submitted a notice of butternut impact form may submit an amended notice form to make the following changes to the notice form previously registered, if the amended notice form is submitted before any impactful actions are undertaken: i.  A change to the description of the impactful actions that will be taken and of the impacts those actions will have on butternut trees. ii.  A change to the day the impactful actions are scheduled to begin. 3.  A person who has submitted a notice of activity form may submit an amended notice form to change the end date of the activity identified in the notice form previously registered, if the amended notice form is submitted before the previously identified end date. 4.  A person who has submitted a notice of butternut impact form may submit an amended notice form to change the date by which the impactful actions identified in the notice form previously registered will end, if the amended notice form is submitted before the previously identified end date. 5.  A person who has submitted a notice of activity form with respect to an activity described in subsection 13 (3) affecting bobolink or eastern meadowlark, or both, may submit an amended notice form to, i.  add either of those species that was not identified in the notice form previously registered to the notice form, if the amended notice form is submitted before there is any impact to the species that is the subject of the amendment, or its habitat, by the activity, ii.  if both species were identified in the notice form previously registered, remove one of them from that notice form before the commencement of the activity for either of the following reasons: A.  The person determines that the species will not be impacted by the activity. B.  The status of the species has changed such that it is no longer listed as endangered or threatened on the Species at Risk in Ontario List. 6.  A person who has submitted a notice form may submit an amended notice form to change the name of the person identified on the notice form as the person responsible for carrying out the impactful actions that may impact butternut trees, or responsible for carrying out the activity, as the case may be, if, i.  the responsible person identified on the notice form previously registered provides written consent to the amendment to the responsible person identified on the amended notice form, and ii.  the responsible person identified on the amended notice form provides the Ministry with a written attestation that the person agrees to comply with the conditions to the applicable exemption under this Regulation. 7.  A person who has submitted a notice form may submit an amended notice form to change the election with respect to the payment of a species conservation charge indicated in the notice form previously registered if, i.  the amended notice form is submitted before, A.  in the case of a notice of activity form, commencing the activity specified in the notice, or B.  in the case of a notice of butternut impact form, undertaking the impactful actions with respect to butternut trees, and ii.  in cases where the person elected to pay the species conservation charge in the notice form previously registered, the amended notice form is submitted before the deadline for paying the charge has elapsed. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (5), 37 (3). (6) For greater certainty, an amendment to a notice form under subsection (5) does not affect the application of an exemption under this Regulation. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (6). (7) If a person wishes to amend a notice of butternut impact form under subparagraph 2 i of subsection (5) to change the description of the impactful actions that will be taken and of the impacts those actions will have on butternut trees, including the identification of additional trees that may be impacted, the person shall, before submitting the amended notice of butternut impact form through the Registry, submit to the Minister an update of the butternut health expert’s report required under paragraph 2 of subsection 24 (1) to reflect the amendment. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (7). (8) If an update to a butternut health expert’s report is required under subsection (7), the 30-day period referred to in paragraph 4 of subsection 24 (1) shall start on the day that the amended report is given by the person to the Ministry. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (8). (9) A person who submitted a notice form may request that the notice be struck from the Registry by submitting a notice of cancellation form to the Minister through the Registry if, (a)  the person has decided not to proceed with the activity or with the impactful actions with respect to butternut trees, as the case may be, and submits the notice of cancellation before the activity is commenced or the impactful actions are undertaken; or (b)  every species identified in the notice form is no longer listed as an endangered or threatened species on the Species at Risk in Ontario List. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (9). (10) In this section, “impactful actions” means impactful actions as defined in section 21. O. Reg. 830/21, s. 2 (10).

(1) If a person who proposes to undertake impactful actions with respect to a Category 3 butternut tree decides to archive the tree, the person shall ensure that the tree is archived by a butternut health expert. (2) Despite subsection (1), if, in the opinion of the butternut health expert responsible for the archiving, any of the following conditions are satisfied, a substitute Category 3 butternut tree shall be archived instead of the Category 3 butternut tree that will be impacted by the proposed impactful actions: 1.  The butternut tree that will be impacted has been archived previously. 2.  The butternut tree that will be impacted is not capable of being successfully archived based on indicators of its health. 3.  There is another Category 3 butternut tree situated in proximity to the butternut tree that will be impacted that is capable of genetically duplicating the butternut tree that will be impacted and that other Category 3 butternut tree, i.  will not be impacted by the proposed impactful actions, or ii.  will be archived or has been archived previously. (3) A Category 3 butternut tree shall not be used as a substitute tree for the purposes of archiving if, in the opinion of the butternut health expert conducting the archiving, any of the conditions described in subsection (2) apply with respect to that tree. (4) Archiving of a Category 3 butternut tree shall be conducted in accordance with the following rules: 1.  The tree shall be marked with non-invasive marking indicating that the tree is to be archived. 2.  The root harm prevention zone of the tree shall be marked with non-invasive marking. 3.  Before a Category 3 butternut tree is killed, harmed or taken, at least 50 butternut scions shall be removed from the tree in a manner that minimizes harm to the tree and in accordance with the rules set out in subsection (5). 4.  At least 30 of the butternut scions removed under paragraph 3 shall be grafted to suitable rootstock. 5.  Grafts of butternut scions shall be maintained and tended to for the first two years after grafting in an environment, such as a greenhouse or cold storage area, that facilitates the survival and growth of the grafts. 6.  A graft shall be maintained in an environment described in paragraph 5 for a third year if, in the opinion of a butternut health expert, it is necessary to do so for the health and survival of the graft. 7.  At the end of the period referred to in paragraph 5 or 6, as the case may be, a graft shall be planted in an archive, conservation nursery, botanical garden, conservation area or arboretum at an appropriate time of year. 8.  Grafts shall be tended to and monitored for at least three years following the date of planting to increase the likelihood of successful establishment. (5) The following are the rules that apply to the removal of scions from a Category 3 butternut tree for the purposes of paragraph 3 of subsection (4): 1.  The removal must take place during the month of February or March. 2.  The scions must be removed from the top branches of the tree. 3.  Each removed scion shall represent at least two years of growth by the tree. 4.  Scions that are being transported after removal must be kept frozen during transport. 5.  All necessary phytosanitary measures must be taken to prevent the spread of disease to or from the location of the tree being archived. (6) The person who decides to archive a Category 3 butternut tree shall ensure that records of the archiving of the tree, or its substitute, are prepared and submitted to the Ministry on or before December 31 of the first year in which the archiving takes place. (7) An archiving record prepared under subsection (6) shall include, (a)  the number of scions that were removed from the tree; (b)  the number of grafts carried out and the number that survived as of the day the archiving record is submitted; and (c)  the number of grafts planted and the location in which they were each planted, whether an archive, conservation nursery, botanical garden, conservation area or arboretum. (8) The person who decides to archive a Category 3 butternut tree shall ensure that an update of the archiving records prepared under subsection (6) is prepared and submitted to the Ministry on or before December 31 of each of the five years following the year of the first archiving record submission. (9) The person who decides to archive a Category 3 butternut tree shall, (a)  retain a copy of the records prepared and updated under subsections (6) and (8) for at least five years after the last year in which an update was prepared; and (b)  provide a copy of the records to the Ministry within 14 days of receiving a request for the records.
