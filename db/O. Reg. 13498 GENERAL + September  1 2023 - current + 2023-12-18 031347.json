With respect to dependent children to whom paragraph 2 of subsection (1) applies, the transition child benefit is calculated as follows: A = ($230 Ã B) â (C + D) where, A =  the monthly amount of the transition child benefit, B =  the number of dependent children to whom paragraph 2 of subsection (1) applies, C =  the total monthly payment with respect to dependent children to whom paragraph 2 of subsection (1) applies under section 104 of the Taxation Act, 2007, and D =  the total monthly payment with respect to dependent children to whom paragraph 2 of subsection (1) applies that represents item âCâ in the formula set out in subsection 122.61 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) as decreased by the sum of $43.75 for the first dependent child, $41.99 for the second dependent child and $41.41 for each additional dependent child.
