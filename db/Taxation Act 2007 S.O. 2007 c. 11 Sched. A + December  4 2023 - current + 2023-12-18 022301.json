A corporationâs mining income for a taxation year is the sum of, i. the amount, if any, by which its mining profits for the year exceed the amount deducted under section 1201 of the Federal regulations in computing the corporationâs income for the year, and ii. its income for the year from industrial mining operations in Canada, other than income included under subparagraph i. 3. Subject to paragraph 4, the amount of a corporationâs mining profits for a taxation year is the amount, if any, by which the sum of the amounts determined under the following subparagraphs exceeds the sum of all adjusted losses for the year from the sources described in subparagraph i: i. the total of the corporationâs adjusted income for the year from, A. the production and processing in Canada of, 1.  ore, other than iron ore or tar sands ore, from a mineral resource in Canada operated by it to any stage that is not beyond the prime metal stage or its equivalent, and 2.  iron ore from a mineral resource in Canada operated by the corporation to any stage that is not beyond the pellet stage or its equivalent, and B. the processing in Canada of, 1.  ore, other than iron ore or tar sands ore, from a mineral resource in Canada not operated by the corporation to any stage that is not beyond the prime metal stage or its equivalent, and 2.  iron ore from a mineral resource in Canada not operated by the corporation to any stage that is not beyond the pellet stage or its equivalent, and ii. if the corporation owns all the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of a railway company throughout the year, the amount that may reasonably be considered to be the railway companyâs income for its taxation year ending in that year from the transportation of the portion of the corporationâs ore that is described in sub-subparagraph i A. 4. A corporationâs mining profits for a taxation year shall be determined as if the corporationâs adjusted incomes and adjusted losses were computed on the assumption that the corporation had during the year no adjusted income or adjusted loss except from the sources described in subparagraph 3 i and was allowed no deductions in computing its adjusted income for the year other than, i. amounts deducted or deductible under section 66, 66.1, 66.2, 66.4 or 66.7 of the Federal Act or subsection 17 (2) or (6) or section 29 of the Income Tax Application Rules\r\n(Canada) for the year to the extent they have not been taken into account in computing the corporationâs gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations in respect of production from Canadian fossil fuel sources, and ii. any other deductions for the year that may reasonably be regarded as applicable to the sources of income described in subparagraph 3 i, other than a deduction permitted under section 1201 of the Federal regulations. 5.

Amount of tax credit (2) The amount of a taxpayerâs co-operative education tax credit for a taxation year is the sum of, (a) all amounts each of which is in respect of a qualifying work placement that ends in the year, equal to the lesser of, (i) the taxpayerâs eligible amount for the year in respect of the qualifying work placement as determined under subsection (8), and (ii) the maximum amount for the qualifying work placement for the year determined under subsection (2.1); and (b) the total of all amounts, each of which is an amount determined by multiplying the eligible percentage by the amount of a repayment, if any, made by the taxpayer during the year, of government assistance in respect of a qualifying work placement to the extent the repayment does not exceed the amount of the assistance in respect of the qualifying work placement that, (i) has not been repaid in a previous taxation year, and (ii) may reasonably be considered to have reduced the amount of a co-operative education tax credit that would otherwise have been allowed to the taxpayer under this Act, the Corporations Tax Act or the Income Tax Act in respect of the qualifying work placement.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (2); 2009, c. 18, Sched. 28, s. 9 (1). Maximum amount for qualifying work placement (2.1) The maximum amount for a qualifying work placement for a taxation year is the amount calculated using the formula, ($1,000 Ã X/Y) + [$3,000 Ã (Y â X)/Y] in which, âXâ is the number of consecutive weeks of the qualifying work placement completed by the student before March 27, 2009, and âYâ is the total number of consecutive weeks of the studentâs qualifying work placement. 2009, c. 18, Sched. 28, s. 9 (2). Qualifying work placement (3) For the purposes of this section, a work placement is a qualifying work placement if, (a) it is a work placement in which a student of an eligible educational institution performs employment duties for a taxpayer under a qualifying co-operative education program offered by the institution; (b) it satisfies the conditions set out in subsection (4); and (c) it is certified as a qualifying work placement under subsection (14).  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (3). Additional conditions (4) The following are the conditions referred to in clause (3) (b): 1. The work placement has been developed or approved by the institution as a suitable learning situation. 2. The terms of the work placement require the student to engage in productive work during the placement, not just to observe the work of others. 3. The work placement is for a period of, i. not less than 10 consecutive weeks, if the placement is under a  program referred to in subparagraph 2 i of subsection (5), or ii. not less than eight consecutive months and not more than 16 consecutive months, if the placement is under a program described in subparagraph 2 ii of subsection (5). 4. The student is entitled to receive remuneration for work performed during the work placement. 5. The terms of the work placement require the corporation to supervise and evaluate the job performance of the student during the placement. 6. The institution monitors the studentâs progress in the work placement.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (4). Qualifying co-operative education program (5) An educational program or course of study is a qualifying co-operative education program for the purposes of this section if it meets the following requirements: 1. The program or course of study formally integrates studentsâ academic studies with work placements. 2. The program or course of study, i. includes work placements, each of which is at least 10 consecutive weeks and at least half of which are mandatory, that total not more than 75 per cent of the time spent in required academic study and that include mandatory work placements totalling at least 30 per cent of the time spent in required academic study, or ii. includes one optional work placement of at least eight consecutive months and not more than 16 consecutive months that totals at least 30 per cent and not more than 75 per cent of the time spent in required academic study. 3. All optional work placements taken under the program or course of study must be completed before the start of the final academic term. 4. The program or course of study provides credit towards a post-secondary degree, diploma or certificate granted by an eligible educational institution in respect of qualifying co-operative education programs. 5. All optional qualifying work placements taken by a student under the program or course of study are recorded on the studentâs academic transcripts. 6. The Senate, board of governors or other governing body of the eligible educational institution, through its authorized delegate, has given to the Minister of Finance, or to his or her delegate, a document stating that the program or course of study meets the requirements of paragraphs 1 to 5.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (5). Division of work placement into consecutive work placements (6) If a qualifying work placement would otherwise exceed four consecutive months, the following rules apply: 1. The work placement shall be divided into periods of four consecutive months, starting at the beginning of the placement, and each full period of four consecutive months is deemed to be a separate qualifying work placement. 2. If the work placement includes a period of 10 or more consecutive weeks that is not included in a period deemed by paragraph 1 to be a separate qualifying work placement, the period of 10 or more consecutive weeks is deemed to be a separate qualifying work placement. 3. If the work placement includes a period of less than 10 consecutive weeks that is not included in a period deemed by paragraph 1 or 2 to be a separate qualifying work placement, the period of less than 10 consecutive weeks is deemed to form part of the immediately preceding period that is deemed by paragraph 1 to be a separate qualifying work placement.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (6). Work placements with associated corporations (7) Consecutive work placements with two or more associated corporations are deemed to be with only one of the corporations, as designated by the corporations.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (7). Eligible amount (8) A taxpayerâs eligible amount for a taxation year in respect of a qualifying work placement is determined as follows: 1. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year is equal to or greater than $600,000, the eligible amount is the sum of, i. 10 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement before March 27, 2009, and ii. 25 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement after March 26, 2009. 2. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year is not greater than $400,000, the eligible amount is the sum of, i. 15 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement before March 27, 2009, and ii. 30 per cent of the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement after March 26, 2009. 3. If the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year is greater than $400,000 but less than $600,000, the eligible amount is calculated using the formula, (10% Ã E) + (25% Ã F) + [(5% Ã G) Ã (1 â H/$200,000)] in which, âEâ is the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement before March 27, 2009, âFâ is the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement after March 26, 2009, âGâ is the sum of all eligible expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the qualifying work placement, and âHâ is the amount by which the total of all salaries or wages paid by the taxpayer in the previous taxation year exceeds $400,000. 2009, c. 18, Sched. 28, s. 9 (3). Same (9) The amount of salaries or wages deemed to have been paid by a corporation in a previous taxation year for the purposes of subsection (8) is the amount that would otherwise be determined for that year if the rules set out in subsections 87 (1.2) and (1.4) of the Federal Act applied.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (9). Eligible expenditures (10) The following amounts paid or payable by a taxpayer in respect of a qualifying work placement are eligible expenditures for a taxation year: 1. An amount paid or payable to a student in the qualifying work placement if, i. the amount is salary or wages paid or payable on account of employment at a permanent establishment of the taxpayer in Ontario, and ii. the amount is required by subdivision a of Division B of Part I of the Federal Act to be included, when paid, in the studentâs income from a source that is an office or employment. 2. A fee paid or payable to an employment agency in consideration for the provision of services performed by the student in the qualifying work placement, if the services are performed by the student primarily at a permanent establishment of the taxpayer in Ontario.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (10). Government assistance (11) The total of all eligible expenditures made by a taxpayer in respect of a qualifying work placement is the amount otherwise determined less the amount of all government assistance, if any, that, on the taxpayerâs filing-due date for the year, the taxpayer has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive in respect of the eligible expenditures.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (11). Exceptions (12) Despite subsection (10), an expenditure made by a particular taxpayer in respect of a work placement is not an eligible expenditure for the purposes of this section, (a) to the extent that the amount of the expenditure would not be considered to be reasonable in the circumstances by taxpayers dealing with each other at armâs length; or (b) if the work placement is with a taxpayer other than the particular taxpayer.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (12). Rules for associated corporations (13) If a qualifying work placement is deemed by subsection (7) to be a work placement with only one of two or more corporations, (a) the corporation designated under that subsection is deemed to have paid all amounts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection (10) that were paid or payable by the corporations, and those amounts are deemed not to have been paid or payable by the other corporations; and (b) the corporation designated under that subsection is deemed to have received or be entitled to receive all government assistance in respect of the work placement that any of the other corporations has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive, and the other corporations are deemed not to have received and not to be entitled to receive that government assistance.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (13). Certification of qualifying work placement (14) Every eligible educational institution in Ontario that has a qualifying co-operative educational program that has qualifying work placements shall certify in a manner or form approved by the Ontario Minister to every taxpayer providing a qualifying work placement that the placement is a qualifying work placement for the purposes of this section, and the certification shall contain the name of the student in the placement and any additional information required by the Ontario Minister.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (14). Minister of Financeâs direction and order (15) If incorrect certifications have been given under subsection (14) or an eligible educational institution has certified a work placement to be a qualifying work placement when it was not, the Minister of Finance may direct the educational institution to cease certifying work placements and may order that all or certain of the work placements of the institution be deemed not to be qualifying work placements for the purposes of this section until the Minister of Finance revokes the direction and order.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (15). Resumption of certification (16) If the Minister of Finance is satisfied that the educational institution will comply with the Minister of Financeâs directions with respect to the accuracy, form and content of certifications to be given under subsection (14), the Minister of Finance, subject to any conditions the Minister of Finance considers reasonable, may revoke the direction and order given under subsection (15), and all work placements that would have otherwise been qualifying work placements while the Minister of Financeâs direction and order were in effect shall, to the extent approved by the Minister of Finance, be considered to be qualifying work placements for the purposes of this section and may be so certified by the educational institution.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (16). Directions under Corporations Tax Act and Income Tax Act (17) Directions and orders of the nature described in subsection (15) that were made under the authority of the Corporations Tax Act or the Income Tax Act shall continue to have the same effect under this Act until revoked by the Minister of Finance in accordance with subsection (16).  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 88 (17). Partnerships (18) The following rules apply if a corporation or individual (in this section referred to as the âpartnerâ) is a member of a partnership and the partnership would qualify for a fiscal period ending in a taxation year of the partner for a co-operative education tax credit if the partnership were a corporation or individual, as the case may be, and the fiscal period were its taxation year: 1. Subject to paragraph 2, the portion of that co-operative education tax credit that may reasonably be considered to be the partnerâs share of the tax credit may be included in determining the amount of the partnerâs co-operative education tax credit for the partnerâs taxation year. 2. If the partner or any other member of the partnership bases a claim in respect of the partnership for the taxation year under subsection (19), no amount in respect of the partnership may be included in determining the amount of the partnerâs co-operative education tax credit for the partnerâs taxation year otherwise than pursuant to subsection (19).  2007, c. 11, Sched.

Interpretation (10) For the purposes of this section, an apprenticeship program is deemed to commence on the date that the contract of apprenticeship is or was registered under the Trades Qualification and Apprenticeship Act or the training agreement is registered under the Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2009 or the Apprenticeship and Certification Act, 1998, as the case may be.  2010, c. 1, Sched. 29, s. 7 (2); 2015, c. 20, Sched. 40, s. 11 (19). Other eligible expenditures (11) Subject to subsections (12) and (13), such other expenditures as may be prescribed are eligible expenditures of a taxpayer for a taxation year if the prescribed conditions are satisfied.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (11). Exception (12) An expenditure made by a taxpayer in respect of a qualifying apprenticeship is not an eligible expenditure to the extent that the amount of the expenditure would not be considered to be reasonable in the circumstances by taxpayers dealing with each other at armâs length.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (12). Total eligible expenditures (13) For the purposes of this section, the total of eligible expenditures made by a taxpayer in respect of a qualifying apprenticeship in a taxation year is calculated using the formula, F â G in which, âFâ is the sum of the amounts determined under subsections (9) and (11), and âGâ is the amount of all government assistance, if any, that, on the taxpayerâs filing-due date for the year, the taxpayer has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive in respect of the eligible expenditures. 2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (13). Employment agencies (14) If a taxpayer pays a fee to an employment agency in respect of a qualifying apprenticeship that is an eligible expenditure of the taxpayer for a taxation year, (a) the taxpayer is deemed to employ the apprentice for the purposes of the definitions of âCâ, âDâ and âEâ in subsection (3), and the employment agency is deemed not to employ the apprentice; and (b) the taxpayer is deemed to be participating in the apprenticeship program for the purposes of paragraph 2 of subsection (7), and the employment agency is deemed not to be participating in the apprenticeship program.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (14); 2009, c. 34, Sched. U, s. 15 (7); 2015, c. 20, Sched. 40, s. 11 (20). Limitation (15) If an amount paid or payable by a taxpayer or a partnership is otherwise used as a basis for a taxpayer claiming a tax credit under section 88, section 43.4 of the Corporations Tax Act or subsection 8 (15) of the Income Tax Act, the amount so paid or payable is deemed to be nil for the purposes of determining the taxpayerâs tax credit under this section.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (15). Partnerships (16) The following rules apply if a corporation or individual (in this section referred to as the âpartnerâ) is a member of a partnership and the partnership would qualify for a fiscal period ending in a taxation year of the partner for an apprenticeship training tax credit if the partnership were a corporation or an individual, as the case may be, and the fiscal period were its taxation year: 1. Subject to paragraph 2, the portion of that apprenticeship training tax credit that may reasonably be considered to be the partnerâs share of the tax credit may be included in determining the amount of the partnerâs apprenticeship training tax credit for the partnerâs taxation year. 2. If the partner or any other member of the partnership bases a claim in respect of the partnership for the taxation year under subsection (17), no amount in respect of the partnership may be included in determining the amount of the partnerâs apprenticeship training tax credit for the partnerâs taxation year otherwise than pursuant to subsection (17).  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (16). Same (17) If it is acceptable to the Ontario Minister, a partnerâs share of a partnershipâs apprenticeship training tax credit determined under subsection (16) for a fiscal period shall be equal to such amount as the partner claims not exceeding the amount, if any, by which the amount of that credit exceeds the total of all amounts each of which is claimed under this section, section 43.13 of the Corporations Tax Act\r\nor subsection 8 (16.1) of the Income Tax Act in respect of the amount of that credit by any other partner.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (17). Limited partner (18) Despite subsections (16) and (17), a limited partnerâs share of a partnershipâs tax credit referred to in subsection (16) is deemed to be nil.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 89 (18).

Amount of tax credit (2) Subject to subsection (20), the amount of a qualifying corporationâs Ontario business-research institute tax credit for a taxation year is the sum of all amounts, each of which is in respect of an eligible contract and is equal to the amount calculated using the formula, A Ã B/C in which, âAâ is 20 per cent of the total of all qualified expenditures incurred during the year under the contract by the corporation, to the extent that no tax credit has been claimed under this section or section 43.9 of the Corporations Tax Act for a previous taxation year in respect of the qualified expenditures, âBâ is the number of days in the year that the corporation is not connected to the eligible research institute that entered into the eligible contract or to any other eligible research institute that carries out the scientific research and experimental development that is to be performed under the contract, and âCâ is the number of days in the year. 2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (2). Qualifying corporation (3) A corporation is a qualifying corporation for a taxation year in respect of an eligible contract with an eligible research institute if, (a) the corporation carries on business in Ontario in the year through a permanent establishment in Ontario; and (b) the corporation or a partnership of which it is a member, but not a specified member, entered into the contract with the eligible research institute.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (3). Corporation connected to an eligible research institute (4) For the purposes of this section, a corporation is connected to an eligible research institute at any time during a taxation year of the corporation if at that time, (a) the eligible research institute owned, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, shares of the capital stock of the corporation that, (i) carry more than 10 per cent of the voting rights attached to voting securities, within the meaning of the Securities Act, of the corporation, or (ii) have a fair market value of more than 10 per cent of the fair market value of all of the issued shares of the capital stock of the corporation; (b) the eligible research institute and the corporation were members of the same partnership or did not deal at armâs length; (c) a partnership of which the eligible research institute is a member owned, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, any of the shares of the corporation; or (d) the corporation and the eligible research institute are connected under the prescribed rules.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (4). Corporate partners (5) If a corporation is a member, other than a specified member, of a partnership at the end of a fiscal period of the partnership in which the partnership would qualify for an Ontario business-research institute tax credit if the partnership were a corporation whose fiscal period was its taxation year, and if the corporation would be a qualifying corporation in respect of the eligible contract if it instead of the partnership had entered into the contract, (a) the portion of the qualified expenditures in respect of which the partnership would calculate the tax credit for the taxation year that may reasonably be considered to be the corporationâs share of the qualified expenditures, (i) is deemed to have been incurred by the corporation and shall be included in determining the total amount of the corporationâs qualified expenditures in respect of the eligible contract for the taxation year in which the partnershipâs fiscal period ends, and (ii) may be included in the determination of the amount of the corporationâs Ontario business-research institute tax credit for the taxation year in which the partnershipâs fiscal period ends; and (b) the corporationâs share of the qualified expenditures shall be the portion of the qualified expenditures that corresponds to the corporationâs share of the income or loss of the partnership for the fiscal period of the partnership ending in the taxation year and, for the purpose of determining the corporationâs share of the tax credit if the partnership has no income or loss for that fiscal period, the partnershipâs income for the fiscal period is deemed to be $1 million.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (5). Eligible contract (6) For the purposes of this section, a contract entered into by a corporation or a partnership with an eligible research institute is an eligible contract if, (a) under the terms of the contract, the eligible research institute agrees to directly perform in Ontario scientific research and experimental development related to a business carried on in Canada by the corporation or partnership, as the case may be, and the corporation or partnership is entitled to exploit the results of the research and development carried out under the agreement; and (b) the contract is entered into after May 6, 1997 or, if the contract was entered into before May 7, 1997, the terms of the contract as they read on May 7, 1997 provide that the eligible research institute will continue to carry out scientific research and experimental development under the contract until a date after May 6, 1999.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (6). Exception, substituted contract (7) Despite subsection (6), a contract entered into after May 6, 1997 that, but for this subsection, would be an eligible contract shall not be an eligible contract for the purposes of this section if the contract may reasonably be considered to require expenditures for scientific research and experimental development that were to be performed under a contract entered into before May 7, 1997 by the corporation or the partnership or by a person related to the corporation or partnership, as the case may be.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (7). Qualified expenditure (8) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an expenditure incurred under an eligible contract with an eligible research institute is a qualified expenditure under the contract to the extent that, (a) the expenditure, when it is made, is, (i) a payment of money made by a qualifying corporation to the eligible research institute under the terms of the contract, or (ii) a prescribed payment; (b) the expenditure is incurred in respect of scientific research and experimental development carried on in Ontario directly by the eligible research institute; and (c) it is an expenditure referred to in subparagraph 37 (1) (a) (i.01), (i.1) or (ii) of the Federal Act that would be a qualified expenditure within the meaning of subsection 127 (9) of that Act, other than an expenditure, (i) that may reasonably be considered to fund the payment of salary or wages to an employee of the eligible research institute who is connected to the corporation making the expenditure, or (ii) that is a prescribed type of expenditure.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (8); 2010, c. 1, Sched. 29, s. 14; 2015, c. 38, Sched. 20, s. 3.

A, s. 97 (9). Expenditure under more than one contract (10) If an expenditure will be applied under more than one contract, a ruling under subsection (9) must be obtained with respect to each of the contracts.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (10). Expenditure before ruling obtained (11) If a corporation or partnership incurs an expenditure under a contract before the Ontario Minister gives a ruling under subsection (9), and the Ontario Minister subsequently gives a favourable ruling, the expenditure is deemed, for the purposes of subsection (9) but not subsection (2), to have been made after the ruling was given if the corporation or partnership applies to the Ontario Minister for the ruling, (a) within 90 days after the day on which the contract was entered into; or (b) no later than three years after the day on which the contract was entered into, and the Ontario Minister is satisfied that the corporation or partnership was unable to apply for the ruling at an earlier time through no fault of its own for reasons that were beyond its control.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (11). Ontario Minister may dispense with requirement for ruling (12) The Ontario Minister may give a direction that rulings no longer need to be obtained under this section in respect of contracts entered into after the date of the Ontario Ministerâs direction, if the Ontario Minister is satisfied that corporations, their officers, directors and shareholders, partnerships and their members and eligible research institutes are conducting their business and affairs in a manner that meets the spirit and intent of this section, and, subject to subsection (13), subsections (9) to (11) will not apply to qualified expenditures made under contracts entered into after the date of the Ontario Ministerâs direction.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (12). Ontario Minister may reinstate ruling requirement (13) The Ontario Minister may, at any time after giving a direction under subsection (12), revoke the direction and give a new direction that subsections (9) to (11) shall apply to qualified expenditures made under contracts entered into after the date of the new direction.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (13).

Publication (15) The Ontario Minister shall publicize directions given under subsections (12) and (13), by bulletin or by any other means of communication that, in the opinion of the Ontario Minister, will bring the directions to the attention of those affected.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (15). Reduction in amount of qualified expenditures (16) The total of all qualified expenditures incurred by a corporation under an eligible contract shall be reduced by any contribution that the corporation, any shareholder of the corporation, any partnership of which the corporation is a member, any partner in that partnership or any person not dealing at armâs length with the corporation or a shareholder of the corporation has received, is entitled to receive or may reasonably expect to receive from, (a) the eligible research institute that entered into the eligible contract; (b) a person who performs scientific research and experimental development that is to be carried out under the contract; or (c) a person who does not deal at armâs length with either of them.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (16). Exception (17) Despite subsection (16), if under the terms of an eligible contract between an eligible research institute and a corporation or partnership, the eligible research institute directly funds part of the cost of performing the scientific research and experimental development that is to be carried out under the contract, the expenditures made by the institute in performing the scientific research and experimental development shall not be considered to be a contribution if, (a) the financial obligations of the corporation or partnership under the contract are not reduced by the amount of any expenditures made by the eligible research institute; (b) the expenditures made by the eligible research institute are not payments made to or at the direction of the corporation or partnership; and (c) there is an agreement in writing between the eligible research institute and all other persons who are parties to the eligible contract that provides the terms and conditions under which the eligible research institute would be entitled to recover the amount of its expenditures.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (17). Same, transactions in the ordinary course of business (18) Subsection (16) does not apply in respect of the provision of goods and services in the ordinary course of a business carried on by the corporation or partnership if, (a) in the case where the corporation or partnership, or another person who does not deal at armâs length with the corporation or partnership, acquires the goods or services, the price paid by the corporation, partnership or person for the goods or services is not less than their fair market value; and (b) in the case where the corporation or partnership, or another person who does not deal at armâs length with the corporation or partnership, is providing the goods or services, (i) the price for the goods or services is not greater than their fair market value, and (ii) the expenditures made to acquire the goods or services do not form part of the expenditures made by the eligible research institute for scientific research and experimental development under the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (18). Repayment of government assistance (19) The total of all qualified expenditures made by a corporation for a taxation year under an eligible contract may include an amount that may reasonably be considered to be a repayment of government assistance made by the corporation during the year, to the extent that the amount, (a) has not been repaid in a previous taxation year; and (b) may reasonably be considered to have reduced the amount of an Ontario business-research institute tax credit that would otherwise have been allowed to the corporation under this section or section 43.9 of the Corporations Tax Act in respect of the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (19). Limit on amount of qualified expenditures (20) The amount of qualified expenditures under an eligible contract with respect to which a corporation may claim a tax credit under this section shall not exceed the amount that may reasonably be considered to be the amount that would have been expended by the corporation if the corporation had carried out the scientific research and experimental development directly in the same circumstances and under the same conditions as the eligible research institute under the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (20). Annual qualified expenditure limit (21) No tax credit may be claimed by a corporation under this section for a taxation year in respect of qualified expenditures that exceed the corporationâs qualified expenditure limit for the year as determined under the prescribed rules.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (21). Subsidiary wholly-owned corporations (22) An eligible research institute is deemed for the purposes of this section to carry out scientific research and experimental development that is carried out by one of its subsidiary wholly-owned corporations, if the scientific research and experimental development activities are required to be carried out under an eligible contract entered into by the eligible research institute.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (22). Subcontracts (23) If an eligible research institute that entered into an eligible contract with a corporation subsequently enters into a contract with another institute that is an eligible research institute or a specified person and under that second contract the other institute performs part of the scientific research and experimental development that is to be carried out under the eligible contract or the specified person carries out part of the work required to be carried out under the contract, the scientific research and experimental development carried out directly by the other institute or the work carried out by the specified person is deemed to be carried out directly by the eligible research institute under the eligible contract.  2007, c. 11, Sched. A, s. 97 (23). When employee connected to corporation (24) For the purposes of this section, where an eligible research institute and a corporation have entered into an eligible contract, an employee of the eligible research institute is connected to the corporation in a taxation year if, at any time in the taxation year of the corporation, (a) the employee or a person who does not deal at armâs length with the employee owned, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, shares of the capital stock of the corporation that, (i) carry more than 10 per cent of the voting rights attached to voting securities, within the meaning of the Securities Act, of the corporation, or (ii) have a fair market value of more than 10 per cent of the fair market value of all of the issued shares of the capital stock of the corporation; or (b) the employee and the corporation are connected under the prescribed rules.  2007, c. 11, Sched.

No amount may be included in determining the individualâs sales tax credit in respect of a qualified dependant who has claimed a sales tax credit for the same year. 3. If another person has included an amount in respect of the individual in determining the other personâs sales tax credit for the year, the individual shall not include an amount in respect of himself or herself in calculating his or her sales tax credit. 4. If two or more individuals inhabit the same principal residence in a taxation year and each of them is entitled to claim a property tax credit for the year in respect of the residence, the total occupancy cost relating to the residence is allocated to each of them according to the following: i. The beneficial ownership of each of them in the principal residence, if the principal residence is not a non-seasonal mobile home and is not a residence occupied pursuant to a life lease or a lease having a term of 10 years or more. ii. The portion of the rent for the principal residence that each of them paid in respect of the occupation of the residence in the year. iii.

In the case of a principal residence occupied pursuant to a life lease or a lease having a term of 10 years or more where the lease has been paid in full, the same percentage of the amount of municipal tax that is reasonably applicable to the residence for the taxation year as the percentage interest of each of them in the lease. 5. If an individual has a qualifying spouse or qualifying common-law partner at any time in the year, only one of them shall claim any property and sales tax credits for the year to which either or both of them would otherwise be entitled. 6. If an individual has more than one taxation year ending in a calendar year, the individual shall have an occupancy cost for only the last taxation year ending in the calendar year and the amount of that occupancy cost shall be the amount that would be determined if that taxation year included all previous taxation years ending in the calendar year, excluding any portion of the occupancy cost that has been taken into account by the individualâs qualifying spouse or qualifying common-law partner in determining a property tax credit for the year.  2007, c. 11, Sched.

A, s. 116 (6); 2008, c. 7, Sched. S, s. 32 (5).

A corporationâs mining income for a taxation year is the sum of, i. the amount, if any, by which its mining profits for the year exceed the amount deducted under section 1201 of the Federal regulations in computing the corporationâs income for the year, and ii. its income for the year from industrial mining operations in Canada, other than income included under subparagraph i. 3. Subject to paragraph 4, the amount of a corporationâs mining profits for a taxation year is the amount, if any, by which the sum of the amounts determined under the following subparagraphs exceeds the sum of all adjusted losses for the year from the sources described in subparagraph i: i. the total of the corporationâs adjusted income for the year from, A. the production and processing in Canada of, 1.  ore, other than iron ore or tar sands ore, from a mineral resource in Canada operated by it to any stage that is not beyond the prime metal stage or its equivalent, and 2.  iron ore from a mineral resource in Canada operated by the corporation to any stage that is not beyond the pellet stage or its equivalent, and B. the processing in Canada of, 1.  ore, other than iron ore or tar sands ore, from a mineral resource in Canada not operated by the corporation to any stage that is not beyond the prime metal stage or its equivalent, and 2.  iron ore from a mineral resource in Canada not operated by the corporation to any stage that is not beyond the pellet stage or its equivalent, and ii. if the corporation owns all the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of a railway company throughout the year, the amount that may reasonably be considered to be the railway companyâs income for its taxation year ending in that year from the transportation of the portion of the corporationâs ore that is described in sub-subparagraph i A. 4. A corporationâs mining profits for a taxation year shall be determined as if the corporationâs adjusted incomes and adjusted losses were computed on the assumption that the corporation had during the year no adjusted income or adjusted loss except from the sources described in subparagraph 3 i and was allowed no deductions in computing its adjusted income for the year other than, i. amounts deducted or deductible under section 66, 66.1, 66.2, 66.4 or 66.7 of the Federal Act or subsection 17 (2) or (6) or section 29 of the Income Tax Application Rules\r\n(Canada) for the year to the extent they have not been taken into account in computing the corporationâs gross resource profits for the year under subsection 1204 (1) of the Federal regulations in respect of production from Canadian fossil fuel sources, and ii. any other deductions for the year that may reasonably be regarded as applicable to the sources of income described in subparagraph 3 i, other than a deduction permitted under section 1201 of the Federal regulations. 5. For the purposes of determining the amount described in paragraph 2 of the definition of âDâ in subsection (2), i. electrical energy and steam are deemed to be goods, and ii. subject to paragraph (l) of the definition of âmanufacturing and processingâ in subsection 125.1 (3) of the Federal Act, the generation of electrical energy for sale and the production of steam are deemed to be manufacturing or processing.  2007, c. 11, Sched.
